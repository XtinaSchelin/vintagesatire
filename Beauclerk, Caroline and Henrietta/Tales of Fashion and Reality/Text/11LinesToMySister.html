  <h1>LINES TO MY SISTER.</h1>

  <p class="author">BY HENRIETTA MARY BEAUCLERK.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="stanza">Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,<br />
  Thee all things lining gaze on.<br />
  <br />
  <i>Milton.</i></p>
  <hr />

  <p><span class="smallCap">Art</span> thou some sylph descended from above,<br />
  To fire the breast of man with hope and love;<br />
  And when their hearts they&rsquo;ll offer unto thee,<br />
  Wilt raise thy hidden wings, and quickly flee?</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>If so, bright fay, depart ere harm is done,<br />
  Nor in these lands again, I pray thee, come;<br />
  If as a mortal thou would&rsquo;st deign to dwell,<br />
  Cast off that form, and all will then be well.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>But she, who now before me radiant stands,<br />
  Is not a being of the fairy lands;<br />
  And, though her form is slight, her features fair,<br />
  She still is not created out of air.</p>
