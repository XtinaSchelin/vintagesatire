  <h1>THE MYSTERY.</h1>

  <p class="author">BY HENRIETTA MARY BEAUCLERK.</p>

  <p class="stanza">What have we here? what meets our eye?<br />
  O, &rsquo;tis a tale of mystery!<br />
  Is it of goblin or of sprite,<br />
  That you have ventur&rsquo;d thus to write!<br />
  Read, and my story will unfold<br />
  A tale that cannot be twice told.<br />
  A deed of darkness brought to light<br />
  Tho&rsquo; long conceal&rsquo;d from human sight.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><span class="smallCap">It</span> was late on a fine summer&rsquo;s evening, that a travelling carriage-and-four, followed by a barouche and pair,—both heavily laden, drove through the small village of Bere-Hacket in Dorsetshire, and entering a park two miles from it, stopped at a noble mansion known by the name of Orton Hall. A hatchment was placed over the portico, and the servants standing on the flight of steps, were habited in black, for the late occupier of this residence had only been dead two months. The coach-door was opened; a gentleman apparently about fifty years old ascended, followed by his wife, a middle aged person, a girl of seventeen, and two more of between eight and ten:—they were all attired in deep mourning. The barouche was filled with maids and luggage, &amp;c. The late Sir Geoffry Lonsdale haying never married, at his death the whole of his valuable property was left to his nearest of kin, Mr. Lonsdale, who now came to reside on his family estate.</p>

  <p>For some time before this occurrence, Mr. Lonsdale had lived at a small villa within a few miles of London, where, without the confinement of a metropolitan life, he had all the benefits of it. His eldest daughter, Laura, received instruction from all the best masters, and was as amiable as she was accomplished. Her features were small and regular; a pair of sparkling dark eyes lighted her countenance with no common brilliancy; her tall and slender figure seemed almost too much for the diminutive foot and ankle to support. Her frank good-natured manner pleased generally, and her two sisters regarded her as a species of idol. Mrs. Lonsdale had produced three sons—all of whom were dead; and her husband thought, with much regret, that if she had no more, the family estate he had just inherited would pass into strange hands, as by a clause in his cousin&rsquo;s will no female could claim it.</p>

  <p>On taking possession he determined not to dismiss any of the old domestics he found there; but to those who were unfit for service, or wished to retire, he allowed liberal pensions. Among the dependants of the deceased was a half-witted man of five-and-twenty, called Billy Grange, who much annoyed Mr. Lonsdale. He had been born on the estate, and both his parent&rsquo;s dying when he was yet an infant. Sir Geoffry had protected and brought him up. He was said to be perfectly innocent, and his late master had the greatest confidence in him. During his last illness he could never be induced to leave his bed-side, attending him with the utmost care and attention. He shed no tear at his death, but from that time he was an altered being. He spoke to no one, hardly ate enough to support life, would rove away for days, and then returning perfectly exhausted, lie down at his late master&rsquo;s bedroom door. Mrs. Lonsdale regarded him with a sort of horror she could in no way account for, and often hinted to her husband she could never feel comfortable as long as the idiot remained at Orton Hall. Laura, on the contrary, tried by every means in her power to assuage his grief, and in a short time she had the pleasure of seeing her efforts rewarded with success; his former cheerful habits returned; he no longer avoided mixing with his companions. His affection for Laura knew no bounds: in all her ramblings he accompanied her; if her young sisters were fatigued, carried them, and would climb the steepest mountain to procure her any moss or stone she expressed a wish to have.</p>

  <p>Winter passed by, and the Lonsdales had become acquainted with most of the neighbouring gentry. Mrs. Lonsdale seldom quitted the house, her health being so very delicate. Laura frequently visited Mrs. Trenton, an old lady, who, with her son, a young man of two-and-twenty, and her daughter, resided within two miles of her father&rsquo;s house, near the town of Bradford Abbas. Nashbrook Priory was situated on a hill well sheltered by surrounding woods; the highly cultivated pleasure grounds descended to the river Ivel, which flowed for a mile through their park. Report said that Laura would soon become mistress of this delightful residence: however that might be, she was always warmly solicited to renew her visits, for she was a great favourite with Mrs. Trenton. Ann Trenton was a month older than herself, and in every way suited to be her friend. Arthur Trenton was doted on by his mother; he was tall, handsome, and to a cultivated mind, was added a great genius for music, which made him much liked by his fair neighbour Laura; yet, while she encouraged his acquaintance, taking great pleasure in his society, she never for a moment imagined any other feeling towards him than that of the most sincere friendship.</p>

  <p>In the month of May, Mrs. Lonsdale became the mother of a son and heir; the event was celebrated with much rejoicing; and on Laura&rsquo;s birth-day, which was the first day in June, a splendid ball was given, to which all the principal families in the neighbourhood were invited. A large party remained in the house to attend the christening of the young heir, who was named Hector Augustus. Mrs. Trenton, her son and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Sedburgh, a distant relation of Mrs. Lonsdale&rsquo;s, and Sir Alfred Swancote, were among the number who witnessed the ceremony. The day after, they all took their leave, save Mr. Trenton, who was to stay dinner and afterwards walk home in the evening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suspect as how we shall have a wedding very soon in this family,&rdquo; remarked one of the footmen as they were all assembled at supper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; replied another, &ldquo;Mr. Trenton seems very sweet on our young missus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ll make a handsome couple,&rdquo; chimed in the lady&rsquo;s-maid; &ldquo;but, I say, Billy, what will you do without your companion? for you always go about after her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A vacant stare was the sole reply this question obtained,—indeed, the person it was addressed to did not seem aware of the presence of any one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good night, Trenton,&rdquo; said Mr. Lonsdale, as he accompanied his guest to the hall-door; &ldquo;it is a very fine night for your walk; I hope your family will not be alarmed at your not returning before. I had no idea it was so late, had you? it is past twelve.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! I shall soon be at home if I go by the high road,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trenton. &ldquo;But tell me at what hour you will be disengaged to-morrow, for I wish to speak very particularly to you.&rdquo; An hour was fixed, and the two friends separated.</p>

  <p>As Mr. Lonsdale and his family were seated at breakfast the next morning, at about nine o&rsquo;clock, a letter arrived from Mrs. Trenton, written in the greatest alarm, stating that her son had not returned the night before, and as he was always strictly punctual, the circumstance had made her feel very uneasy, as she feared he was either ill, or that some accident had happened to him, and begged Mr. Lonsdale would send word immediately as to what had occurred.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is very extraordinary,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Lonsdale, as he finished reading the letter out loud; &ldquo;I really hope nothing has befallen young Trenton; he was perfectly well last night when he took his leave, and indeed mentioned that he should call here this morning at eleven. Ring the bell, Laura, I will have my horse saddled and ride over to the Priory; but in the meantime send my servants about the neighbourhood to inquire after poor Trenton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But all inquiries were useless; no clue could be obtained, however faint, to trace where the young man was. Mr. Lonsdale was the last person who had seen him: he repeated the conversation they had had together, on parting, to Mrs. Trenton, and they came to the conclusion, that he was detained forcibly, by parties expecting a large ransom would be offered for him. Accordingly Mr. Trenton declared that if any one could throw the smallest light upon the affair they should be rewarded by the sum of one thousand pounds; but, notwithstanding this announcement, no information of any sort or kind could be afforded. The high road was carefully inspected, but if any struggle had taken place there, it could not have been discerned, as it had rained violently at five in the morning. Mrs. Trenton was suffering all this time the greatest agony and suspense of mind; the idea that her only son had been waylaid and murdered now firmly took possession of her, and she gave herself wholly up to the full sway of maternal grief. The Lonsdales tried in every manner to console her, but the wretched mother was deaf to words of comfort; her heart was nearly broken. The once happy home was now a house of mourning, nothing but tears and lamentations were heard. The gay Ann Trenton was inconsolable, yet still she exerted herself so far, as to call at the residences and examine every person she thought likely to have seen her brother: but at last she was obliged to agree with Mr. Lonsdale in thinking that nothing but time could unravel this <em>mystery</em>. Months passed by, still nothing was heard of Mr. Trenton; his mother appeared to be daily sinking, and indeed often declared that she should not long survive the blow. Laura spent most of her time with her, vainly striving to whisper hope, for she felt herself that Arthur Trenton was no more.</p>

  <p>A general election was announced about this time. Mr. Lonsdale was warmly solicited on all sides for his vote, but his choice was already made in favour of Mr. Knighton, who, besides being a young man of great promise, was related to all the first families in the county. In the short time that Mr. Lonsdale had resided in Dorsetshire, he had become a great favourite, and was universally esteemed. The poor found in him a warm friend, who listened to their tales of distress and injury with patience, and where harm was done, procured them some redress. Mrs. Lonsdale and her daughter were much interested in the fate of the contest, and the windows of a house in Bradford, opposite the hustings, had been engaged for them to witness the motley scene. The sum paid for the three windows they were to occupy, was thirty pounds, and the owner of the shop was so delighted at the arrangement, that he forsook his party, and voted for Mr. Knighton; so much for the honourable feelings of persons concerned in electioneering affairs. After a severe contest, Mr. Knighton was returned: the ceremony of chairing took place. Among the rabble that followed the hero of the day, the tall gaunt figure of Billy Grange might be discerned, decked with every colour of the rainbow, and dancing about in high glee. A splendid entertainment was given by the new member to his constituents, and he settled to dine with Mr. Lonsdale in two days, on his road to London. The former strongly urged his sleeping at Orton Hall, but Mr. Knighton excused himself on the plea, that he should start very early in the morning for town, and therefore preferred sleeping in the village of Bere-Hacket, where there was a very good inn. Two or three friends were asked to meet him, and the evening passed off very pleasantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Billy,&rdquo; bawled one of the footmen in the ear of the unhappy idiot, &ldquo;master wants you to be at the hall-door at eleven o&rsquo;clock, with a lantern to light Mr. Knighton to the village,—mind you&rsquo;re punctual.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye, never fear,&rdquo; replied the half-witted creature, as he quietly relapsed into the deep slumber lie had been roused from.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s none other but Mr. Knighton going away to-night, is there?&rdquo; demanded one of the servants.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; they all stay till to-morrow, and I fancy he&rsquo;d like it better if he&rsquo;d be going to stay, for they say as how he is courting Miss Laura.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll make a go of it, for it was a monstrous uncod thing, t&rsquo;other man of her&rsquo;s disappearing so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Knighton, laughing as he was bidding his host good night, &ldquo;that I shall not be spirited away like our poor friend Trenton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! that was a sad business,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lonsdale; &ldquo;but I have ordered one of my servants to light you to the village; and with him you need not fear any thing, for he is strong and powerful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Lonsdale, pray do not think I am afraid to go home alone; I really cannot think of taking one of your men out at this time of night. No, no, it is impossible: I was only joking, no one will think of harming me,—besides, it will be the worse for them if they attempt it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All Mr. Lonsdale&rsquo;s entreaties were of no avail; and he saw Mr. Knighton depart alone with much regret, and not without a feeling of superstition that something would happen to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, my dear Mr. Lonsdale,&rdquo; said Sir Alfred Swancote, when the former returned to the drawing-room, &ldquo;You have done every thing in your power, and if Knighton is so very obstinate, he must abide by the consequences; but I really hope he will get safe to the village,—however, to-morrow we shall know.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr />

  <p>&ldquo;I think we may consider that Mr. Knighton is safe on his road to London, for if any thing had occurred we should have heard of it before now; do you not agree with me, papa?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, my dear Laura, I hope so,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lonsdale; &ldquo;but I have been very uneasy all night about him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Knighton&rsquo;s groom wishes to speak with you a moment, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed the servant, entering with alarm visibly marked on his pale face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God! what has happened?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Lonsdale, rushing from the room, and following the servant into the hall, where he found the groom.—&ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; said he, entering his library, and at the same time dismissing the attendant, who was likewise anxious to gain what information he could. &ldquo;Now tell me quickly, what has happened to your master?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure; I haven&rsquo;t seen master since he came to dine here yesterday, and he told me to be ready at five this morning with the horses, as he should ride to town. So seeing he did not come, I inquired of the people of the inn, and they said he&rsquo;d never been home the night before, and perhaps might have slept at the hall. So I waited till nine o&rsquo;clock, thinking he might come after breakfast, and finding he didn&rsquo;t I rode up here to inquire after him, when your servant told me as how he had left here last night, to go to the village.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All was consternation; it was evident that the same fate had befallen the young member, as that which had formerly been Mr. Trenton&rsquo;s. Mr. Lonsdale consulted his friends upon the best method of informing the parents of the unfortunate man, and they agreed it was better to wait till the evening, before they communicated with them. In the meantime. Sir Alfred was to ride to Blandford for the magistrate, and Mr. Lonsdale with his friends, were to examine the neighbourhood. At three o&rsquo;clock, the magistrate arrived, when every person was separately examined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is the servant who was to light Mr. Knighton to the village?&rdquo; asked the magistrate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lonsdale; &ldquo;but he is an idiot, and I am afraid can tell you nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Such was the case; for the poor creature remained in a corner of the room, his eyes and mouth wide open, and when he was questioned, terror seemed to deprive him of the little reason he possessed. At the close of this minute investigation, they were not a bit more advanced than at the beginning; nothing at all could be ascertained as to the disappearance of Mr. Knighton, and Mr. Lonsdale had the painful task of informing his parents of the melancholy catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Knighton would not believe that her son was no more, and vainly imagined he would soon return. Her husband, on the contrary, perceived by Mr. Lonsdale&rsquo;s manner, that he thought such a thing hopeless, and the tears streamed down his cheeks as he turned away to conceal from his wife the grief he could not suppress. Mr. Lonsdale recapitulated every circumstance connected with this mysterious affair, and it was settled that Mr. Knighton should proceed as soon as he could to Orton Hall, and there join the officers of justice in their investigations of the mystery no one could solve.</p>

  <p>The whole county took the alarm, and every where young Mr. Knighton&rsquo;s disappearance was the subject of conversation. The residents of Bere-Hacket decided, that Orton Hall was haunted, and some of them went so far as to declare, that at a certain hour, the ghosts might be seen walking through the park, and about the place. Not one of the servants dared venture out after dusk, many of them gave warning, and such a feeling of superstition pervaded the whole house, that Mrs. Lonsdale saw every chance of being very soon left without any domestics at all. Each morning brought a fresh account of some terrible spectre they had seen; no maid durst go about the house without a companion; as soon as night closed in. Shrieks were heard from the terrified domestics as they pursued their different vocations. Mr. Lonsdale urged every plea to dispel their imaginary fears,—he even watched for a few nights to persuade them that the evil spirit existed only in their own minds; but all his arguments were vain. The county in the meantime, was in a state of excitement not to be described. Blandford being deprived of its member, another election took place, and Sir Alfred Swancote was returned. Mr. Knighton gave up the hope of ever seeing his only child again; not so his wife; each succeeding day, she exclaimed, &ldquo;I am certain we shall hear of Henry today: he must come back soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Lonsdale was perfectly astonished when she pronounced this, for it was nearly a year since Mr. Trenton had been missing, and no tidings had ever been heard of him. As to poor Mrs. Trenton, she was entirely confined to her bed, and the only person she saw, was the clergyman of the parish, who attended her every day, and poured the consolations of religion into her broken spirit. Ann was much changed, and no longer went out any where; indeed, her close attendance on her mother rendered such a thing impossible. The society in the county was completely altered; the friendly intercourse of neighbour to neighbour was stopped; no one ventured to leave Orton Hall at night, and at last, Mr. Lonsdale foreseeing that he should soon be completely isolated and forsaken, determined to go with his family to the Isle of Wight, till these unpleasant adventures should be forgotten. Mrs. Lonsdale and Laura were delighted at the change,—for the youthful spirit of the latter had become much depressed by the recent occurrences.</p>

  <p>A house was engaged for them at Ryde, near the sea, where they removed as soon as possible; and on landing there, Mr. Lonsdale heard his wife say to Laura, &ldquo;This is the first time I have ever felt happy since the birth of Hector.&rdquo; They were agreeably surprised at finding Sir Alfred Swancote and his mother residing in the island, where they intended to stay three months. The Lonsdales&rsquo; house was near theirs, and every day the families met either to join in some excursion on the water, or to view the different beauties in the Garden of England. Three months passed by, which appeared to Sir Alfred and Laura, not to be more than three weeks; when Mr. Lonsdale announced his intention of returning to Dorsetshire. Accordingly, the two families separated, but with the idea of soon meeting again,—for Sir Alfred had become so captivated with the charms of the youthful Laura, that he had solicited her hand, and after his return from town, their marriage was to be solemnized in Dorsetshire.</p>

  <p>With much regret, Mrs. Lonsdale again revisited Orton Hall; herself and children had derived much benefit from the invigorating air of the Isle of Wight, and her antipathy to the estate they had inherited, increased by absence. The county still wore the same air of apprehension and mystery, as when they left. No tidings had ever been learnt of Mr. Trenton or Mr. Knighton. Mrs. Trenton was still lingering at death&rsquo;s door, and the doctors, though they could advise no remedy for her disorder, gave it as their opinion, she would soon be released from the ills of this world. Laura found the poor idiot, Billy Grange, much altered; his body was wasted away, and his intellects were even worse than before her departure; all efforts to rouse him were ineffectual; for hours he would sit with his head hid between his knees, and if disturbed, the fierce rolling of his eyes, with the passionate exclamations that burst from his lips, terrified even his benefactress.</p>

  <p class="sep">* * * * *</p>

  <p>From the following letter, Mrs. Lonsdale wrote on her return, to Mrs. Sedburgh, the state of her feelings may easily be seen:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not ask you to come and see me, however great the enjoyment of your society would be at this moment, for this mysterious affair has not as yet been solved. How sincerely do I regret that Mr. Lonsdale ever had this place left him; the melancholy event that has happened, has completely disgusted me with Orton Hall. The only solace I find, is in my children. I go out as little as possible. You know my horror for what is termed visiting, in the country, and as Laura is shortly to be married, there is no necessity for my so doing. Poor Mrs. Knighton, whose only joy was in her son,—the member for Blandford,—after having sustained hope for the space of four months, is now perfectly childish, yet still she indulges the idea that he is not dead.</p>

  <p class="sep">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Winter now announced its approach with hard frosts and snow. Laura&rsquo;s marriage was announced to take place in a fortnight. Her intended husband became an inmate of Orton Hall, whilst his mother was to stay at his estate four miles from thence, till a few days before the ceremony, when she was expected to join the wedding party. All was joy, activity, and preparation; both Mr. and Mrs. Lonsdale approved of the match; the former liked it, because Sir Alfred was rich, of good family, and a member of Parliament; the latter, because her daughter would not go far away, and therefore she would not be deprived of her society.</p>

  <p>A week before the wedding, the family was assembled one evening in the drawing-room, when a servant came in, and said, that Sir Alfred Swancote&rsquo;s coachman had just been to announce that Lady Swancote was very ill, and that he was going on to Bere-Hacket to fetch the doctor as quick as possible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious, how unfortunate!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Alfred, hastily rising: &ldquo;excuse my departure, dearest Laura; but I must instantly go home to my mother. Heaven grant her illness is not dangerous!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! surely you are not going to walk there alone to-night?&rdquo; replied Laura, seizing hold of Sir Alfred&rsquo;s arm, as he was hurrying to the door. &ldquo;Oh, no! you will be killed. Father! prevent him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Laura, you surely would not wish to detain me, when my mother perhaps is dying?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; replied she, as the crystal drops flowed from her dark eyes; &ldquo;but pray, for my sake, take some one with you; remember Mr. Trenton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never fear, Laura, no one will harm me whilst I have this oak stick to defend myself. Come, dearest, this is silly to weep so; let go my hand, I shall be very safe.&rdquo; And kissing her fair brow, he gently disengaged his arm from her grasp, and placing her on a chair in the hall, rushed swiftly from the house, fearless of all danger. Quickly he traversed the park, and crossing the high road, entered a wood on the other side of it.</p>

  <p>The air was cold and chilling; the moon at its full, cast a pale, sickly light through the trees, forming broad shadows. At any other time. Sir Alfred would have paused to observe the brightness of thousands of stars which darted over the deep gray sky,—one for a moment dimmed by some greater light, then again emitting its brilliancy, as it moved away; but he was now in no humour to gaze on the beauties of nature; his mind was occupied with other things; his mother&rsquo;s illness and Laura&rsquo;s fears were predominant. Suddenly the shadow of a man seemed to appear from behind, and occasionally vanish. Was it fancy? no; surely another step but his might be heard on the hard dry ground. Sir Alfred turned to look: the oak stick beheld, and which he had so relied on, was wrenched from his grasp by a force scarcely human; a cloud passed over the moon, but it emitted enough light for him to distinguish that some large stick or hammer was suspended over his head; he snatched at the hand that held it, and diverted the blow. Fierce was the struggle, the momentary darkness rendered it more awful. Sir Alfred had to wrestle with an invisible foe. Now was he cast to the ground, while he fell the weight of his adversary press on his body; now did he feel an iron grasp encircle his throat, and almost put an end to life; now did he start from the ground, and shielding his head from the impending blow, hurl his enemy from him. All was total obscurity. Their hands and garments were so saturated with the blood that had been spilled, that they could not retain their grasp. Sir Alfred could not rid himself of his unknown foe,—one effort, and all was over. His adversary had clasped him round the waist,—Sir Alfred paused a second,—and the next he had cast himself against a tree with the stranger. No sound escaped his lips,—nought was heard save the deep quick respiration of Sir Alfred, and the rustling of the leaves as the cold night breeze moved them, making the scene more desolate. The strong arms that had held him in their grasp, gradually relaxed their hold, and Sir Alfred was once more free. The moon now appeared from behind the dark cloud that had lately hid its brightness, the rays descended through the almost leafless branches, and shed a broken light on the creature stretched at his feet. The man seemed tall, and formed for great strength; his jacket was covered with blood, which likewise prevented his features from being discovered. The crimson fluid streamed copiously from a deep wound on his temple; an occasional groan was the only sign that life was not extinct. Sir Alfred hesitated; should he leave this man to die from the wounds he had inflicted on him? no; he could not do it. His strength was failing him, but a little exertion, and he might save one, who would have murdered him; so returning good for evil. He bound his handkerchief round the stranger&rsquo;s forehead, disengaged the huge hammer from his hand,—which in death he firmly clutched,—and half carrying, and partly dragging the body, he reached Orton Hall; with a last effort he rung the door bell, and weak with the loss of blood, fell fainting on the steps.</p>

  <p>All slept within, save Laura: repose was banished from her frame; on her knees she was imploring the Divine Power to watch over, and protect her lover. The sounding of the bell broke through the silence that reigned around; hastily snatching the lamp that shed its pale yellow light, she passed quickly from her room, through the long dark passages leading to the spacious hall, and with a trembling hand, drew back the massive bolts that fastened the entrance; the light shone on the bloodstained face of Sir Alfred Swancote. She neither shrieked nor fainted; but stooping down, endeavoured to raise him up. Mr. and Mrs. Lonsdale had both heard the bell, and fearing something had happened to Sir Alfred, they proceeded down stairs, where they found the group described. The alarm bell was rung, and in a short time most of the household were assembled, adding to the scene of confusion. Sir Alfred was conveyed to his apartment, followed by Mr. and Mrs. Lonsdale. Laura was prevailed upon to retire to her room, whilst the unknown foe was left to the care of the domestics, and when the blood was washed from his mangled face, they recognised the idiot Billy Grange! Restoratives were administered to both, which had the desired effect, and after some time, Sir Alfred was sufficiently recovered to relate the particulars of the attack that had been made on him. Mr. Lonsdale was called away to visit the other wounded person, who has been already mentioned; he maintained a sullen silence, apparently suffering much from the injuries he had received. His master implored him to say, why he had so ill-treated Sir Alfred, and what his motive had been. Groans issued from the sufferer&rsquo;s mouth, as he vainly essayed to speak; some wine was given to him, and leaning towards Mr. Lonsdale, as if blessed with returning reason, he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think you it is strange, the mother should curse the wretch who robs her of her all! feelings may be hidden; but still they exist. Oh, that my arm could have proved as fatal to Sir Alfred, as it has done to those who are no more! Aye, you had a long and fruitless search; but no one ever imagined the idiot had aught to do in that transaction. I, who have been the laughing stock of the place, have likewise caused hot burning tears to flow, and the knowledge of it has pleased me. You need not fear,&rdquo; added he, as Mr. Lonsdale shrank from the bed-side, &ldquo;if I wished, I could not harm you; that youngster has pretty nigh disabled me; he fought hard, dark as it was:—not so the others; one blow, and all was over; for fear the dead should tell tales, <em>this</em> settled the business,&rdquo; and searching the pocket of his coat he pulled out a thick cord. &ldquo;You know the ponds by the wood-side; well, the centre one is deep, and partly covered with rushes and weeds, there rest the remains of Mr. Trenton, and Mr. Knighton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh God!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Lonsdale, &ldquo;is it indeed so? what could have tempted you to perpetrate such a crime? unhappy man!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unhappy? true, I have failed in my last attempt and Sir Alfred lives—Oh! that I had had strength to kill him, and then I should have died content; but now! the wretch will gain his object, and Laura will be his. <em>Fool</em> as I am, gratitude and affection still could prevail in my heart, yet was I thought insensible. The idiot that has been sneered at, could still love his benefactress: as the careful hen watches over and guards her young brood, so have I regarded <em>one</em> that is dearer to me than she can ever be to him, who will ere long call her wife! When sorrow pressed heavily on my feeble mind, her soft voice soothed the grief that others mocked at, and said, &lsquo;the <em>fool</em> can cry as well as laugh.&rsquo; For nights have I watched about the house, and during the day dogged the footsteps of my victims; fortune at last favoured me, and the intended husbands of my benefactress, perished by my hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence! I will hear no more; to crime you have added deceit, and under the mask of idiotcy, have perpetrated deeds too horrid to be thought of. But justice shall be done at last. John,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;guard that ruffian well; I will send for the magistrate, and in the mean time watch him closely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; replied the drowsy servant, as his master locked the door on his departure, and sinking into an arm chair, he was soon absorbed in the sleep he had been roused from.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lonsdale despatched a messenger to Bere-Hacket for the doctor, and to Blandford for the magistrate. Mrs. Lonsdale had dressed Sir Alfred&rsquo;s wounds, none of which were deep, and his faintness proceeded more from loss of blood, and over exertion, than from any danger. There was no fever in his frame, and having taken a sleeping draught, he sank into a refreshing slumber. The doctor was at Lady Swancote&rsquo;s, and his return that night was uncertain. In three hours the magistrate arrived; Mr. Lonsdale informed him, in short, of what had occurred, and they proceeded together to the murderer's apartment. They unlocked the door, and entered. The servant was fast asleep; and hanging over the side of the bed, was the body of Billy Grange; with a knife that had been left in the room, he had stabbed himself to the heart!</p>

  <p>The pond near the wood was searched, and the two bodies were found in a state of decomposition; by the different marks on the clothes they were distinguished, and the remains of each, sent to their respective homes. Mrs. Trenton beheld the corpse carried by four men coming up the park, and clasping her shrivelled hands, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Thy will be done!&rdquo; when Ann Trenton turned round, her mother was no more;—she was an orphan. Lady Swancote&rsquo;s illness which had nigh caused her son&rsquo;s death, was nothing but spasms in her side,—a complaint she was liable to, and which by warm applications were soon removed. Sir Alfred recovered from the injuries he had received, and became the happy husband of Laura Lonsdale. Billy Grange was buried in unconsecrated ground, in a cross road, and with a stake driven through his body.—Thus perished the originator of &ldquo;<span class="smallCap">the mystery</span>.&rdquo;</p>
