  <hr />

  <p>From time immemorial, marriage has been considered as the most happy and blissful state, man or woman can enter. In our earliest childhood, we are instructed in those accomplishments likely to fascinate the understandings of the opposite sex, (namely, the male); and the charms likely to enslave their minds are studiously practised as we advance in years. Little is it ever imagined, that the infant just born, lying helpless and feeble in the nurse&rsquo;s arms, will some day become a leading star in the bright hemisphere of fashion; courted and flattered by the gay and wealthy; trampling on the heads of many, as they kneel to do homage to her transcendent beauty. Time rolls on,—years pass by,—and still the same scene occurs; but with little alteration. The budding girl is transformed into the sober matron, with perhaps one or more daughters so seek establishments for in the world. Her own feelings have become blunted by age and time; she no longer remembers the love she bore her husband, when first united to him,—for that passion has sobered down into a sort of platonic attachment. She fancies the only object a young lady has in marrying, is to improve her station in life, both in respect to money and connexions; never thinking for a moment love could hold any sway in her daughter&rsquo;s choice, as she considers that feeling seldom exists except in the imagination.</p>

  <p>Such, however, are not my ideas. I have lived long in the world, and in my experience have found, that the happiest marriages are those in which a mutual regard for each other prompted the parties,—if their means allowed of it,—to enter into the holy state of matrimony. I am not an advocate for people marrying to reduce each other to a state of beggary; nor on the other hand, for unions founded entirely on avaricious motives. Persons may be united,—minds only can meet. &ldquo;A great fortune with a wife,&rdquo; says an old adage, &ldquo;is a bed full of brambles.&rdquo; A late writer remarks, &ldquo;The real beauty of your heiress is the ready penny, and she is chosen like old plate, not for its fashion, but its weight and value; what though her eyes want brilliancy, her diamonds possess that virtue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It is a dangerous thing for a young person just emancipated from the school-room, to be allowed to plunge headlong into the whirlpool of fashion, without a mother, a friend, or a chaperon, to guide her through the difficult path of life. Men may be very clever, but they are not capable of superintending the début of a young girl; that task is always much better fulfilled when intrusted to the management of one of the female sex.</p>

  <p>As a mother, and chaperon, I have been highly successful. Nearly every scheme I have formed, has turned out well; it is certain no pains were ever spared, and the commodity I had to dispose of was of the best quality. Lord Burleigh has said, &ldquo;Marry thy daughters, lest they marry themselves.&rdquo; From the time I became a member of the respectable bench of chaperons, I made use of the above learned saying as my motto. Yet I have never forced my daughters into marriages inconsonant to their feelings. When a man, desirable in every respect, has presented himself to their notice, I have certainly enumerated his good qualities, and encouraged his attentions to the utmost; this I consider quite fair, as young girls cannot be expected to possess the circumspection of their parents in those affairs, a thorough knowledge of which can only be acquired by years of intense study, and deep observation.</p>

  <p>Before I mention the various trials I underwent in endeavouring to marry my youngest daughter, I will, for the benefit of chaperons, give, what I have always considered with respect to Fashionable Life, the</p>

  <h2>TEN GOLDEN RULES.</h2>

  <p>In early life, let your children be instructed in every accomplishment suited to females. If they have not an innate taste for music, let it be an acquired one. Some men prefer a clever wife to a pretty one.</p>

  <p>The daughter must not be a proficient in more languages than the mother. Conversations may be carried on in foreign tongues, full of important matter to the. young lady and chaperon; which, if the latter is unacquainted with the language, might be productive of much harm.</p>

  <p>When told your daughter is lovely, do not contradict that opinion, it seems only like affectation, denying what is really the case; besides, the world is always very willing to detract from the merit possessed by any individual.</p>

  <p>Never speak ill of another person&rsquo;s daughter: it can do no good, and appears envious. Every one is lovely in the eyes of their respective admirer.</p>

  <p>Observing the same things daily, breeds indifference. Young ladies should not be seen too frequently by the person you wish to interest in their favour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A maid oft seen, a gown oft worn,<br />
  Are disesteemed, and held in scorn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old adage of &ldquo;hot love soon cold&rdquo; I have often found in my long experience to be true. That which has been kindled with haste, seldom retains its heat long.</p>

  <p>It is absolutely necessary that a chaperon be perfectly well acquainted with the peerage, in all its intricacies and details. The débutante should likewise have a slight knowledge of that important work. Shakspeare must have laboured under a temporary aberration of intellect, when he wrote, &ldquo;What's in a name?&rdquo; Surely the names of Howard, Fitzroy, Russell, Lennox, Montague, &amp;c., &amp;c., will bear the palm over those of Brown, Johnson, Thompson, Figgins, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>If a girl unfortunately takes a fancy to a man, unfit to be her husband, it must not be noticed. &ldquo;Love turns the more fiercely for obstructions.&rdquo; If the passion increases, talk the subject over lightly,—detect some feature he possesses not quite in harmony with the rest of his person,—criticise, and laugh at it; for Addison says, &ldquo;Ridicule perhaps is a better expedient against love, than sober advice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Beware of younger sons; they are a race especially patronized by girls, who are not aware of the danger of such proceedings. In general society they are of use to call the carriage, take mothers to the supper-room, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Never be guilty of taking your daughter to country-balls: she can only acquire bad manners, rude habits, and vulgar notions. A girl of rank and fashion ought to feel that London is <i>her element</i>.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>I am the mother of a family of six daughters, five of whom are all well married. Emily, the youngest, has been at every watering place, every ball, opera, breakfast, and concert, during five tedious summer campaigns; but she still remains on hand, without my being able to divine the reason. This greatly surprises me, as she is allowed by every one to be agreeable, witty, and handsome: some are ill-natured enough to say she is a flirt, but people are so envious, the fault cannot be mine. I will here, for the general instruction of the world, give an account of my qualities as chaperon.</p>

  <p>I have the extraordinary talent of never being <i>de trop</i> in a <i>tête à tête</i>. When I am not wanted, I can gaze intently on the opposite side of the room, perhaps start a new subject when the conversation flags, and when once more set going, drop at once into perfect silence. Sometimes I can lend a deaf ear; nay more, rival in blindness the goddess of fortune. It is my extreme good luck that I am blessed with a very strong constitution, so that I can endure the utmost fatigue in situations the most harassing. My daughter is, indeed, very fortunate in possessing a mother with so sweet a temper as mine. With such favourable circumstances, and all her excellent qualities, it is very hard I cannot unite Emily to some <i>bon partie</i>. With Emily I have been so peculiarly unfortunate, that to hinder all chaperons from committing the same faults I have unintentionally been guilty of, I will give an account of a week&rsquo;s exertions during a full London season; I here make a faithful extract from my private journal,—a work I have kept with the utmost regularity, however great the excitement I have laboured under.</p>

  <p>June the 12th, Monday.—Had been engaged to Lady Mortimer&rsquo;s water party for some time; it was, however, at Emily&rsquo;s most earnest request that I went. The party consisted of Lady Charlotte Stanby, and her daughter Fanny: Lady Charlotte is the daughter of a duke, who cast her off for marrying a penniless ensign in the guards: Mrs. Munford, two daughters, and two sons, both also without a sixpence. These two latter are dangerous rivals, being handsome, and already much admired by the young ladies. Captains Cropsley and Lee; Lords Arthur Tresham, and Lovell; Mr. Selby, Sir Horace Meredith, and two sons of Lady Mortimer, both in the army. Knowing the people who were to be there, told Emily beforehand that I wished her to devote her particular attention, either to Sir Horace Meredith, or Lord Lovell. Our place of destination was Richmond. On leaving Whitehall stairs, my horror may be conceived, when I saw Emily seated at the end of the boat, engaged in earnest conversation with Captain Lee, the youngest of a family of ten children. His father is, indeed, the son of a marquis, but with an income of only two thousand a-year to educate his large family. Heavens! what I endured—I coughed, I fidgetted, I laughed, I groaned, yet all to no purpose; to use a very odd proverb, &ldquo;none are so deaf as those that won&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Star and Garter&rdquo; was decided upon as the place for dinner, an endroit renowned for pic-nics. Emily and Captain Lee had the start of me, and set off with all expedition towards the house in question. I thought it better not to pursue them, for the heat was intolerable, and pretending to be very much fatigued, begged Sir Horace would give me his arm, which I seized with great earnestness. Emily I praised to the skies, at the same time declaring that Captain Lee was going to be married to my daughter&rsquo;s most particular friend; it is to be hoped he never will repeat this conversation, as there is not a word of truth in it. At dinner I was seated opposite to Emily, and in vain tried to catch her eye. Addressed Lady Charlotte Stanby, who told me that Captain Lee was going to India,—heartily wished he was there already. Mrs. Munford said, in her horrid cunning way, &ldquo;that it seemed quite an <i>affaire arrangée</i> between Captain Lee and my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I could have murdered her, but with the utmost presence of mind, I drew myself up, and replied: &ldquo;My daughter knows her station in life too well, to think of marrying a penniless scamp, Mrs. Munford; therefore I must request of you not to circulate such foolish reports.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>How any thing else went on I cannot say; I had ears and eyes for nothing but my own vexations. Coming home, I made Emily sit between myself and Sir Horace, but she would hardly speak to him. When my head was turned to address Lord Lovell, Sir Horace left his place, and Captain Lee immediately seated himself by Emily, and began singing Italian duets with her; which, as I do not understand the language, might have been replete with tenderness; but whether or no, his eyes sparkled with an expression of love, which greatly add-to my distress.</p>

  <p>On our return home, Emily rushed to her room before I could say a word to her. What my sufferings were on that particular day, none but a chaperon can feel. Retire to bed with the full determination of lecturing her to morrow on her improper conduct. What will people think of it?</p>

  <p>Tuesday.—Had several visiters in the morning, but no Sir Horace Meredith;—I sent him a ticket for the opera to-night.—Lectured Emily well about Captain Lee;—could not continue long, as she never replied, but looked very sulky.—Went in the evening to the opera;—Sir Horace did not come;—hope he is not piqued at Emily&rsquo;s conduct of last night;—several people came into our box, amongst others, Mr. Selby.—Did not mention the party of yesterday, it being rather a sore subject;—cannot help fancying he is in love with Emily;—do not think it is a desirable match; but there is no harm in it, as these little flirtations give éclat to a fashionable girl.—Do not approve of married men flirting, or unmarried ones flirting with married women.—Left before the ballet began, to go to a ball at Mrs. Stratton&rsquo;s;—the rooms were very hot and crowded;—thank goodness! Captain Lee was not there; had he been, I should have gone distracted. A Mr. Carpenter was introduced to Emily;—I was told he had come to London to choose a wife;—he has ten thousand pounds a-year, with a very fine place in Yorkshire. How I wish he would take a fancy to Emily! he is not exactly good-looking, but still there is nothing <i>qui choque</i>. Emily danced with every one in the room;—thought she never would have stopped. At the desperate hour of five, said, &ldquo;My dear, do go home; it is so late; the horses have been waiting two hours in the rain, come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, indeed, mamma, only one more galoppe. I really must dance it, I have been engaged all the evening to Lord Lovell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On hearing this, waited of course with the utmost patience till every one was gone;—had a violent head-ache and a sore throat, from sitting in a passage with a window open behind my back;—found that my India shawl, worth fifty guineas, had been stolen from the cloak-room, and was forced to take an old washed English one, which Emily not looking at, said, was just as handsome as my India shawl. <i>Malheur d&rsquo;autrui n&rsquo;est que songe</i>.</p>

  <p>I must here advise all young ladies who wish to be admired, never to stay later than two at a ball in the summer; for after that hour the morning sun appearing, its brilliancy does not well accord with flushed cheeks, faded dresses, and straight ringlets; besides, only inferior men stay after that hour,—people, indeed, that I should not like my daughter to dance with. This notion I could never instil into Emily&rsquo;s head, as she says the &ldquo;fun of a ball only begins at four in the morning.&rdquo; What an opinion!</p>

  <p>Wednesday.—Sore throat no better;—received a note from Sir Horace, saying he was very sorry he could not avail himself of my kind offer last night, as he stayed at Lady C. Stanby&rsquo;s till too late for the opera.—Hope to goodness he is not <i>épris</i> with Miss Stanby; if so, &rsquo;tis Emily&rsquo;s fault for being so rude to him, as many a heart is caught in the rebound. Mr. Selby has just been here: he made a formal declaration to Emily, which she refused;—really felt much for the poor young man, he seemed so distressed; but it is just like her, encouraging at one moment, and rejecting the next. So ill this afternoon, could not go out in the carriage;—Emily went out riding in the park with her cousins;—gave her strict injunctions not to flirt with Captain Lee; but whether she followed the advice or not cannot tell;—she returned in high spirits.—Went so late to Almack&rsquo;s, that our usual place was occupied;—Emily very cross, never considering it was all her fault for being so long dressing.—Sir Horace never quitted Miss Stanby all night, it was remarked by the whole room. I really wonder how people can be so barefaced.—Captain Lee was there;—Emily went on just in the same manner as before with him. Whenever she saw me coming, she went into the tea-room, or the card-room with Captain Lee; could not follow, owing to the crowd. Two young men in the guards were introduced to us; Captains Fortescue and Granby;—they seemed really to have formed a belle passion for us, as they never left us the whole night;—they are both good-looking, and the names are good. I have not as yet heard what their fortunes are, but I rather think that Fortescue is a relation of the Herbert family, who are all well off. Thank goodness, the ball was over by three;—Weippert&rsquo;s band going away at that hour. We took Captain Fortescue and Sir Henry Clifford, home;—I could not, therefore, lecture Emily on her behaviour. If my throat be not better to-morrow, I really cannot go to Mrs. Cavendish&rsquo;s concert.</p>

  <p>Thursday.—Determined not to say any thing about Captain Lee to Emily, as he will soon be off to India;—obliged to go out early to return visits;—several cards left in my absence; amongst others those of Captains Fortescue and Granby, and Mr. Carpenter;—dined at Lady Caroline Elliott&rsquo;s, and called for Emily to go to the concert at eleven. The dinner party consisted of twenty-four people, too many to be agreeable. Lady Caroline told me, to my great dismay, that Sir Horace had proposed to her friend, Miss Stanby, last night, at Almack&rsquo;s, and that he had been accepted. Who would have doubted that the Stanbys would have accepted six thousand a-year? When I made known the marriage to Emily, I could not help scolding her bitterly, for having so foolishly lost such an excellent chance. She answered with the greatest pertness, that she thought she had come to an age when she could judge for herself, and that it was perfectly immaterial to her, who Sir Horace married. This insolence was insufferable, and I made her fully aware of my opinion.—Arrived at Mrs. Cavendish&rsquo;s: Grisi and Rubini were singing a most beautiful duet from Anna Bolena;—Emily was almost instantly surrounded by an idle <i>côterie</i> of gay young men, much to my annoyance;—there was no possibility of getting a chair for love or for money. I had to stand, first resting on one foot, and then on the other, till I was ready to faint from fatigue; so that the beautiful strains of Grisi, Brambillia, Ivanhoff, and Rubini, received with delight by the vast crowd, and encored with reiterated plaudits, gave a prolongation to my miserable torture, and I never was more relieved than when the happy evening was over.—Invited some people for Vauxhall Gardens to-morrow, as Emily is very anxious to see the fireworks of the &ldquo;Fête de Versailles;&rdquo;—if they all come, our party will be Lady and Miss Talbot, Lord, Lady, and the Miss Vernons, Mrs. and the Miss Munfords, Lords Lovell, Bruce, and Arthur Tresham, Sir Henry Clifford, Mr. Carpenter, and the two Mr. Talbots;—to assemble at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and afterwards adjourn to my house for supper, and finish with dancing.</p>

  <p>Friday.—Got up, feeling very poorly;—my face all swollen with a violent tooth-ache, caused by an open window in my bed-room;—scolded the maid for her carelessness.—Lady Charlotte Stanby called this morning, and did me the honour to inform me of her daughter&rsquo;s intended marriage,—I of course congratulated her with seeming cordiality, all the time wishing herself and her daughter at the bottom of the Red Sea.—Afternoon wet, stayed at home,—Emily fidgetted me to death by running every five minutes to the window to watch the weather, which, fortunately for my peace, cleared up at six o&rsquo;clock;—kept our appointment, and were soon joined by our party;—Emily walked with Lord Lovell;—divided in two parties, each of which chose which route was most agreeable. Judge of my astonishment, on rejoining the party, to see Emily walking with Captain Lee! and Lord Lovell with old Mrs. Munford; how he came there, cannot by any possibility guess: Emily could not surely have asked him;—bowed to him very coolly, expecting when we entered our carriage he would have withdrawn, but to my infinite horror, I heard Emily say, &ldquo;Oh, pray come in, there is plenty of room for you.&rdquo; Near fainting; but obliged to bear all with the utmost resignation. The supper passed off very well;—think a great deal of Champagne was drunk: but that was nothing to me, as Gunter provided hot meat, ice, wine, &amp;c. all for five shillings a-head,—which I think was very reasonable. If managed well, parties are not extravagant. Captains Fortescue, Granby, Greville, and several others, dropped in,—the latter introduced me at Mrs. Cavendish's; a very quiet, handsome young man;—think Emily is rather taken with him;—hope so, as I like him much better than Captain Lee, whom it would really be impossible for Emily to marry.</p>

  <p>The party did not break up till three in the morning;—never saw people dance as they did;—happy to say, Emily was more general than usual in her attentions;—Captain Lee looked very much out of spirits;—can&rsquo;t think why;—did not inquire, for fear of awakening those sensations I would have forgotten;—perhaps it was merely a lover&rsquo;s quarel;—I do not approve of the manner in which introductions are made now-a-days. In my time, the gentleman was first introduced to the mother; but in these reforming days, there is a change in every thing, and the daughter takes precedence of the mother.—Heard, much to my surprise to-night, that Captain Greville is married,—it is well I found it out so soon, for it is no use wasting powder and shot, on one already disposed of.</p>

  <p>Saturday.—Sadly afraid my health is breaking;—so ill this morning was obliged to lie in bed till dinner-time;—don&rsquo;t know who called to-day;—Emily had, I believe, a great many visiters.—So worried by her to go to the opera, that I was forced to consent, nevertheless thinking all the time it would be the death of me. What amusement can Emily find in seeing the same opera and the same ballet twice a-week? On entering the box, to my very great surprise, saw Captain Lee established there;—am certain that this morning, when I was in bed, Emily gave him a ticket;—he sat almost in Emily&rsquo;s lap;—am certain she never heard a word of the opera, she was so taken up with his conversation.—So ill, realty could not stop this horrid exposure;—begged Emily would come away before the ballet was ended, which she assented to, to my very great astonishment;—entering my bed-room, threw myself quite exhausted on the sofa, and turning round, beheld Emily on a chair by my side. Before I could ask her the cause of her unusual presence, she thus spoke: &ldquo;You must be almost aware of what I am going to tell you: Captain Lee proposed to me to-night, and I have accepted him.&rdquo; I shrieked out with surprise, &ldquo;My dear mamma,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;pray do not vex yourself about this,—remember what is done, cannot be undone; besides, why should you dislike my marrying Henry. Poverty is no disgrace, and if that is the only fault you can find with him, that is soon cleared away; he has two thousand pounds a-year, and I am sure that is enough for any one to live very happily upon.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that is your opinion, my dear Emily, I shall say no more about the matter; all I hope is, you will not verify the proverb. &ldquo;Marry in haste, and repent at leisure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>How thankful I was to hear Captain Lee had two thousand pounds a-year, and what a weight was taken off my mind, the reader may readily conceive. The money, I have since learned, was left him by an old aunt, whose god-son he was. It is strange this important news had not been communicated to me. What have I not done to prevent this match, which really, now that I have learned all the particulars, will not turn out so badly.</p>

  <p>My chief object in life is ended. All my daughters are married, some better than others; but still it is a great thing to have gained six men for one family. The task I have accomplished was an arduous one; but I have succeeded without money, in doing what many cannot, that have that luxury in their possession; showing thereby, that beauty will carry the palm sometimes over wealth. The excitement my feelings have laboured under, when engaged in any difficult plot, has caused me many a sleepless night, and my strong constitution has naturally suffered. Mental agony has, perhaps, for a time disturbed the equanimity of my temper; but those for whom I have thus laboured, must excuse it, as it was in their cause. The success I have had is entirely owing to the amiability and personal charms of my daughters; for never in any instance, have I found the relations, of my deceased husband, or self, say a good word in my favour, or lend a helping hand when in their power so to do; on the contrary, it was always cited against me as very extraordinary, if I performed any wonderful <i>coup de main</i>.</p>

  <p>The week is ended.—I leave it now to the judgment of my young friends to say, if I have not been an admirable chaperon. Let them bear in mind the heat, the fatigue, the exertions, I have gone through; the vexations, the trials, the anxieties, I have undergone; the cutting speeches, the sneers, the impertinences that have been addressed to me, enough to sour the milk of human kindness,—and then decide.</p>

  <p>I lay down my pen, fully satisfied I have performed the highly responsible duties of a mother, better than most people. Emily might, or might not, have made a better marriage. I am certain of one thing, that</p>
