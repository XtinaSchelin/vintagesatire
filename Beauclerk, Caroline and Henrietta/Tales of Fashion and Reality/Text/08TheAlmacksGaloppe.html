  <h1>THE ALMACK&rsquo;S GALOPPE.</h1>

  <p class="author">BY CAROLINE FREDERICK BEAUCLERK.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="stanza">Momentary as sound,<br />
  Swift as a shadow, short as any dream.<br />
  <br />
  <i>Shakspeare.</i></p>
  <hr />

  <p><span class="smallCap">Now</span> Weippert&rsquo;s harp each youthful breast inspires,<br />
  A space is clear&rsquo;d, the dancers take their ground,</p>

  <p>Each dancing beau claims her he most admires—<br />
  With pleasure here all youthful hearts rebound.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>But see, the galoppe&rsquo;s graceful, joyous strain,<br />
  Makes the red rose mount high in beauty&rsquo;s cheeks,</p>

  <p>Old damsels round for partners hunt in vain,<br />
  Th&rsquo; unrivall&rsquo;d one his favour&rsquo;d fair one seeks.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Enchanting dance!—the growth of German land—<br />
  At thy gay signal fairy feet are flying;</p>

  <p>Soft vows are made, and broke, as hand in hand<br />
  The dancers rush in speed each other vying.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s mark the num&rsquo;rous vot&rsquo;ries of this dance:—<br />
  L— first rushes like a headstrong filly,</p>

  <p>Cranstoun and Walpole may be said to prance,<br />
  Smith&rsquo;s so, so,—and ditto, Baron Bille.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>E&rsquo;en envy now is mute at Erskine&rsquo;s grace,<br />
  While Hillsborough a Hercules advances;</p>

  <p>Who can cease gazing on Alicia&rsquo;s face,<br />
  Till Blackwood smiles, or Fanny Brandling dances.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>St. John,—sweet Maynard,—pretty Stanhope glide,<br />
  And lively Hill, inciting gentle Karr,</p>

  <p>Meade and Regina ambling side by side,<br />
  In dancing this, are all much on a par.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Oh! now observe, Maude, Littleton, and Brooke,<br />
  Flowers so pure, you'd deem from heav&rsquo;n they fell,</p>

  <p>While N—t—n, queen-like in her very look,<br />
  Would make a desert bliss,—a heav&rsquo;n of hell.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Desperate rush a band of raw recruits,<br />
  With ardent minds, and no regard to time—</p>

  <p>I beg their pardon, but they are such brutes.<br />
  They must excuse my writing such a line.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Hark! a sound as if from a percussion,<br />
  Follow&rsquo;d by piercing shrieks, arouse our fears;</p>

  <p>Chaperons rise alarm&rsquo;d, and dread concussion—<br />
  A prostrate beauty is dissolv&rsquo;d in tears.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Think not the prospects of the night are turn&rsquo;d,<br />
  For a bright vision glances in the ring;</p>

  <p>No sooner is he seen, than all are spurn&rsquo;d.<br />
  They seem his subjects,—he appears their king.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>* * * * in whom the gift of dancing lies,<br />
  For graceful ease none can with him compare,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swift as an arrow from the shaft he flies&rdquo;—<br />
  Envied by men, and worshipped by the fair.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>See him, like the forked lightning flashing,<br />
  No ear can catch the sound of his footfall,</p>

  <p>Down the room the gallant * * * dashing,<br />
  The pride of Almack&rsquo;s—darling of a ball.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>All things at length must cease, and so must this;<br />
  I&rsquo;ll end what bumpkins call the gallopade;</p>

  <p>Sweet unmeant speeches pass from Miss to Miss,<br />
  All go to flirt, drink tea, and lemonade.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>The galoppe&rsquo;s ended, so my lay must stop;<br />
  As a finale I propose to sing,</p>

  <p>(While love-sick beaux, to belles the question pop),<br />
  With loyal heart and voice—Long live the King.</p>
