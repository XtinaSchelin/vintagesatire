  <p class="stanza">Deep in my soul that tender secret dwells,<br />
  Lonely and lost to light for evermore,<br />
  Save when to thine my heart responsive swells,<br />
  Then trembles into Silence as before.</p>

  <p><i>Byron.</i></p>

  <p class="stanza">&ldquo;Love is a feeling none can well explain,<br />
  Though it prevails in every action of our life;<br />
  Love is a passion we defy in vain,<br />
  As it will come, despite of every strife.<br />
  Love is a passion then in some as pure,<br />
  As the fresh tear it causes oft to flow;<br />
  Love is a malady that nought can cure,<br />
  It is an ill that comes to high and low.&rdquo;</p>

  <hr />

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Lord Woodford, we must go to town next week. I know your dislike to a London life; but now you must sacrifice your own private feelings for the good of your children. Gertrude was nineteen last month, and she has not been as yet presented in the world; it really is sad neglect on your part It is true I have tried to remedy it by having visiters constantly here; but Sara, who is seventeen, is old enough to come out, and I can remain no longer in the country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, stop!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Woodford. &ldquo;I am very willing to go to the expense of hiring a house in town for you, provided you will allow me to remain here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Woodford was satisfied, and speaking in a voice which very much resembled the crowing of a victorious cock, she thanked her husband for this fresh proof of his regard for his children; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;my chief object for going to town, is to try and bring about a marriage between Gertrude and Lord Maurice. You shake your head, but I am certain, from what I saw during his stay here this winter, that he likes her. I must confess Gertrude did not behave at all well; she was always talking to that Italian Count you took up so warmly, and nothing would satisfy you but that he must stay here the whole of the winter. One thing is, that Lord Maurice liked him very much, and if he did think the Count admired her, it would only make him more anxious to marry her, for flirting at the right time often forwards a marriage, more than any attention or civility would. Lady Graham is moving heaven and earth to get Maurice for Lady Charlotte, and no wonder; he is a prize worth any one&rsquo;s trying for; but I am of opinion that Gertrude&rsquo;s youth and beauty will have a better chance of wearing his coronet, than the middle-aged, red-haired daughter, of a fortune hunter. I shall not trouble myself this season about Sara; she is young, and can wait. Henry will be of age very soon, and I must try and find him a rich wife to repair the fortunes of our house! That will for the time monopolize my utmost talent,—for where I am to find him one. Heaven only knows,—really the nobility of the present day are a set of paupers!&rdquo; Lady Woodford stopped, exhausted, and raising her eyes from a heap of Easter bills, perceived her husband buried in a pamphlet on the advantages of machines for breaking stones, and was evidently none the wiser for her learned dissertation; but having gained her point, she was in too good a humour to quarrel with him; and quitting the large arm chair in which she had so ably spoken, she left the room to write and engage a house in London.</p>

  <p>The girls, (as their brother the Honourable Henry Morley called them,) were delighted at the prospect of being introduced in the beaumonde. Gertrude in particular, was aux transports; the house could not contain her, and mounting a pony she galloped to the vicarage before Lady Woodford could inform her of all her plans. In a few moments Gertrude had told her good news to the vicar&rsquo;s three daughters, whom she regarded almost as sisters. They regretted her intended departure extremely; but Gertrude consoled them, by promising to write frequently, and rising, put a stop to a conversation, which now that her first joy was over, became fatiguing in the extreme to her restless-spirit, and wishing the trio good-bye, she was preparing to remount her pony, when a voice which she immediately recognised as that of Sidney Wells&rsquo;s, (the vicar&rsquo;s only son,) begged her to stop for one moment. In an instant he was at her side, and though Gertrude observed his more than usual paleness, she was perfectly unaware of the cause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me. Miss Morley,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for interrupting you; but I hear from your father that you are going soon to leave this place; perhaps this will be the last time I shall ever see you, unless,—unless you will deign to accept my hand. I know you think me mad to propose such a thing; but, oh! if you only knew how deeply, how devotedly I have loved, my conduct would no longer appear foolish. I am conscious how different our stations in life are. You are the beautiful, accomplished, and wealthy daughter of a noble baron; I the lowborn, unknown son of a country vicar; yet my heart beats as warmly as that of one possessed of rank and riches.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold! Mr. Wells, I would not spurn you on account of your poverty, or humble birth; but it is useless thinking I ever can be your wife. I acknowledge I never could endure staying all my life in the country. No; take the advice of a true friend and marry one possessing more your own taste than I do. Adieu! we go to town next week, and I hope by the time we return, Gertrude Morley, with all her faults, will cease to hold any sway over your mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Something like a tear dimmed for awhile the brightness of her eye, as waving her hand she galloped down the field in which the vicarage stood. The globule which had started to her eye now found its way unchecked down her fair cheek; she thought of the pain she had unwillingly given one who had ever been most kind to her. &ldquo;Yet, after all,&rdquo; murmured she, &ldquo;it was better to be frank; how could he suppose for a moment that my mother would accept him as a son-in-law? no, no, I fear me that none but him I cannot love, will ever sue me with success.&rdquo; This last sentence was accompanied by a deep sigh; a melancholy look stole over her fair face, and in the weeping form that now presented itself to view, no one could have recognised that cheerful being who seemed but a short time ago to possess no other feeling than joy.</p>

  <p>Sidney Wells, in the meantime, remained rooted to the spot where his hopes of bliss had vanished for ever. His strained eyeballs in vain strove to catch a last glimpse of Gertrude, as she faded from his view. &ldquo;Oh Gertrude!&rdquo; exclaimed he, &ldquo;you little know the bitter pang you have caused me. Now have you parted for ever with a person hateful to your most tender feelings; never again shall you have it in your power to spurn me. No; my proud spirit rebels against such humiliation. Rank! thou bane of human happiness, wherefore was such a distinction ever known! Because my birth is humble, am I less worthy the love of the high-born Gertrude than any noble in the land? Does rank bring happiness? Does wealth bring content? Oh! surely it must, if the poor and lowly can feel so much,&rdquo; and clenching his hands he wept in all the bitterness of unrequited love.</p>

  <p>Great was the surprise of the inhabitants of the West Riding to read in the weekly paper that &ldquo;Lord and Lady Woodford and family had left Yorkshire for their house in town,&rdquo; where they meant to reside for some months. The paper further stated, that the cause of the noble family visiting the metropolis, was the celebration of their eldest daughter&rsquo;s approaching nuptials with the Earl Maurice, one of the richest peers in England. It was not till the end of the week, that an antiquated spinster, who had read the paper eight times over, discovered in the midst of a column that, Sidney Wells, gent, only son of the Reverend J. Wells, had enlisted as private in the regiment of foot about to sail for India. Various were the the surmises this intelligence gave rise to. Had he quarrelled with his father? Was he out of his mind to go as a private to India for eighteen years, where so many died? The gossips at last came to the conclusion, that Mr. Sidney Wells had gambled so much, and had incurred such heavy debts at times, and at places unknown to them, that to prevent incarceration in the county jail, he had levanted. The report was then circulated that the Reverend J. Wells, vicar of Hadborn, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, was so embarrassed in his circumstances, that the only means he had of satisfying his creditors, arose from the stipend of a small vicarage.</p>

  <p>The last thought Gertrude gave to Sidney Wells was consoling in the extreme to her own mind. She fancied his was a love that absence would diminish, and finally check. She knew not the agony he was enduring, and little did she imagine, while resting at her ease in their splendid town mansion, that her rejected lover, for her sake, was tossing on the troubled waters of the wide ocean, perhaps doomed soon to rest forever in the treacherous element on which he sailed. The Miss Morleys&rsquo; debut was perfect. The severest critics could not discover any fault in their graceful figures. Some admired the dark brown eyes and slender taille of Sara, more than the bright blue eyes, and full contour of her sister; all agreed they were lovely.</p>

  <p>Lady Woodford&rsquo;s first care on her arrival in town, was to be presented at court; for this purpose she applied to her sister Lady Elverton, who was renowned in London for her good balls and parties. Lady Woodford determined not to see too much of her sister, as having three daughters out, and two in the school-room, they might clash with her girls. It was astonishing the degree of complaisance the men showed to these graces. Of a morning, their drawing-room was crowded; out riding in the noon, they were always escorted by some half-dozen cavaliers, anxious to be invited to dinner, or to have an opera ticket presented to them. In the evening, at the balls, the Lady Barnetts were never known to remain seated five minutes all night; they seemed to be a kind of mania. Lord Elverton had been dead five years, and his only son, a youth of fifteen, was studying with a tutor at Munich, where he had been sent on account of delicate health. The eldest Lady, Fanny, was tall, thin, and termed by the world a very lady-like looking person. She possessed a small quantity of what is generally considered the greatest ornament of beauty,—according to Mr. Rowland,—namely, a good head of hair; and though she declared it was a proof of low birth to have a luxuriant covering for the head, she was guilty of robbing the dead to supply what she had not. Lady Fanny&rsquo;s hand and arm was considered perfect, and a sure way of being invited to her mother&rsquo;s balls was to mention that the party interested had purchased a cast of it, at Sarti&rsquo;s, the Italian sculptor. The second, Lady Sophia, was perfectly different in her manner, appearance, and disposition to her sisters. She had always been reckoned very plain in her family, and from the frequent hints and cuts that had been thrown out, her mind was completely soured. Aware of her extreme ugliness, she set up for being very clever, and claimed the privilege of saying whatever came uppermost in her thoughts. Lady Amelia was a general favourite; the world forgot in her good-nature, the coldness of one sister, and the pertness of the other. She was universally allowed to be very pretty, none of her features were remarkable for beauty; but the tout ensemble formed an agreeable and lively countenance. The Miss Morleys soon declared their preference for Amelia; the gentle spirit of Sara shrank from the rudeness of Sophia, and the warm hearted Gertrude openly condemned the cold formal manner of Fanny. At the drawing-room. Lady Woodford met with numerous friends she had been acquainted with formerly; but how changed were they! The beautiful Julia Sinclair was transformed into the matron-looking Mrs. Keith, with four daughters and six sons, all bearing a dreadful likeness to their hideous father. Harriet West,—who had never been remarkable for any great share of personal attractions, now that she wore a turban, and had passed the age of forty,—was considered very handsome as Lady Kirton; besides, she had nearly the best set of diamonds of any one in London. The clever and talented Louisa Walton had never been able to convince any man of her great worth, and at the present time was at that hopeful age when she imagined herself too young to be called an old maid,—a title the world had bestowed on her long since. Miss Walton was a regular diner out, being asked for the purpose of making the dinner pass off pleasantly; consequently her stock of puns, sayings, and conundrums, were as antique as herself. She played badly on the piano-forte, sung like one of the feline species chaunting a dirge, made the strings of the harp fall a note at her touch, and nearly put the guitar in hysterics. The only person Lady Woodford found who retained any degree of her former looks, was Lady Caroline Brudenell; in days of yore, she had been very intimate with her, and now eagerly renewed the acquaintance. There were two things in Lady Caroline&rsquo;s favour in the eyes of Lady Woodford; she had no daughters, and was a widow.</p>

  <p>A month after her arrival in London she wrote the following epistle to Lord Woodford, who after the drawing-room, had retired into the country.</p>

  <p>MY DEAR HUSBAND,</p>

  <p>The girls&rsquo; début in London has been crowned with success. I did not think they would have created so much sensation. The trouble I have had to get invitations to all the balls, is astonishing; the set of people having entirely changed since I was in town twenty years ago. Parties have increased wonderfully; in my time there were three Almack&rsquo;s in the season, the tickets one guinea, and afterwards a very good supper. Now the Almack&rsquo;s are held once a week, price of your ticket, if you take a set, seven and sixpence a-piece. No refreshment, save some lemonade,—sour enough to give the cholera,—and chalk and water, dignified by the name of tea. Altogether, they are much gone off. Country dances are quite out of fashion; the mania now are galoppes: I know not how to describe it; couples run up and down the room without any settled figure; the concussions are sometimes dreadful,—I do not admire it; but I hear every one saying it is delightful. Lady Caroline Brudenell tells me it is positively necessary I should give a ball; she has promised to invite the company, as I am not acquainted with the set at present going. I have fixed it for this day three weeks, and think it will be a very good one. Numbers of cards are left daily, but they are names I never heard of before; I suppose they are friends of Lady Caroline&rsquo;s, she has introduced a great many of them to me; but I get quite confused with all the faces. Henry has been of great use, introducing partners to the girls; they are very popular, and know nearly all the young men in London. Gertrude, I think, is the most admired, perhaps, because she has higher spirits than Sara, who is looking thin; but that is likely to be occasioned by the late hours we keep. I can assure you that ever since I have been in town we have never been in bed till past five in the morning; Saturdays and Sundays excepted. Lord Maurice has not yet returned from Paris, but is expected daily. I am sorry to tell you that Count Alberti is in London, and paying great attention to Gertrude, which she does not seem by any means to dislike. This must all be put a stop to before Lord Maurice comes to town, as he will be more difficult to manage here than in the country. Henry introduced Lord Ramsay, a great friend of his, to me; he is tall, thin, good-looking, but has not much to say for himself. We dine to-night at my sister&rsquo;s, who has a ball in the evening. I make a point not to go there too frequently,—you know my reasons. Tell Slater to send up as many plants as he can to ornament my house the night of the ball, and to come himself, as he may be of use. I will write soon. Believe me, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Sarah Isabella Woodford.</p>

  <p>P. S. By Lady Caroline&rsquo;s advice, I have taken an opera box for the season, at four hundred guineas; which I do not think extravagant, as it is in the best part of the house.</p>

  <p>That night Lady Elverton gave a splendid ball at her house in Grosvenor Square, where all the rank, beauty, and fashion, in the metropolis presided. &ldquo;I declare every one in London is here!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Charlotte Brampton, to a very cross-looking chaperon. &ldquo;I never saw such a crowd,—it is impossible to dance; but tell me who is that girl in white, with a red wreath, standing near Lady Amelia Barnett?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely you know her,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weston; &ldquo;it is Sara Morley, Lady Woodford&rsquo;s youngest daughter. I never saw her looking so well; and I fancy it is not a little owing to the presence of Lord Maurice, with whom she is dancing.&rdquo; Lady Charlotte frowned and turned away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady Woodford, allow me to congratulate you on the two marriages that I hear are about to take place in your family.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, Sir James, you are mistaken; neither of my daughters are going to be married; they are only just come out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon. Lady Woodford; but Lady Caroline Brudenell told me Miss Morley was going to marry Count Alberti, the handsome foreigner, and that your second daughter was to be united to Lord Maurice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It is impossible to describe the look Lady Woodford gave Sir James; for a phrenologist it would have been a difficult task to have decided the different feelings and emotions visibly acting on her countenance. No one feeling predominated; it was a compound of every horror portrayed in one look. She had not as yet learned that art which all good chaperons must possess, whether natural or acquired, namely, of hiding her own feelings; and Sir James&rsquo;s <i>mal-à-propos</i> speech added to a violent indigestion caused by the dinner being over-dressed, roused her ladyship&rsquo;s temper to such a pitch, that seeing a small opening in the crowd before him, Sir James rushed forward and arrived in the centre of the room in time to be stretched on the floor, by the combined exertions of the animated Miss Ann Irum, and the splendid waltzer Captain Netherby, The fallen hero was speedily succoured, and the men, to show their great wit, repeated the singularly new quotation of &ldquo;Richard is himself again.&rdquo; Every one reads Shakspeare, some if they do not possess patience enough to peruse the whole, dive into a very useful publication entitled &ldquo;Elegant Extracts,&rdquo; and there find pointed out to their notice, the most famous speeches of the above-named author, headed by explanatory titles as to the sense of the quotations. All wish to shine without much trouble, all learn from the same book, and all repeat the same speeches, till the ear is sick, with—&ldquo;Oh that I were a glove upon that hand!&rdquo;—&ldquo;Sweets to the sweet,&rdquo;—&ldquo;Who steals my purse, steals trash,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the ball. Lady Fanny, who piqued herself particularly on the way in which she executed the Mazourka, proposed one, and accordingly it was formed, but one couple was wanting. &ldquo;Where is Gertrude Morley?&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Fanny, &ldquo;I know she dances it; do fetch her Lord Maurice.&rdquo; His lordship obeyed, and found Lady Woodford and her daughters in the cloak-room, in the act of retiring. Gertrude joyfully assented to join in the dance, and Lady Woodford, thinking her daughter was engaged to Lord Maurice, followed them to the scene of action, where, to her great surprise, she saw Count Alberti lead off the first figure with Gertrude, whilst Lord Maurice followed with Lady Amelia. Every one knows the length of a Mazourka; the eternal unchanging tune,—the measured step declares the feeling of the country in which it originated. Lady Woodford thought it interminable, and at six in the morning, was just courting the drowsy god.</p>

  <p>A week after this, Lady Woodford, having desired not to be disturbed, conducted Lady Caroline Brudenell into her private sitting-room, and commenced the negotiation of a marriage she had long had in view. Neither more nor less,—she had offered her a husband in the person of the Honourable Henry Morley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has your son desired you to speak to me on this subject?&rdquo; replied Lady Caroline, rather astonished, at this proposal, which did not at all meet her plans, as she intended marrying an earl, or marquis, at least, if tempted to divide her fourteen thousand a-year with a second husband.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Henry, certainly, has never authorized me to mention it; but I am sure he is only waiting a favourable opportunity to declare himself your devoted admirer. Our long acquaintance justifies me, I think, in telling you how much Lord Woodford and myself would like such an alliance; you are the only person I know, that I should approve my son marrying.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Caroline gave no definite answer, talked of her dislike to marrying again, and what the world would say to her choosing so young a man, and the <i>tête à tête</i> ended with her promising to dine with Lady Woodford at six o&rsquo;clock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh mamma! Lord Maurice has taken a box at Drury Lane, and hopes we will go there to-night, to see Malibran in &lsquo;Fidelia,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gertrude, as Lady Woodford entered the room, after her interview with Lady Caroline Brudenell,—&ldquo;and begs you will ask any of your friends. He invited Lord Ramsay and my brother who met him here this morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Woodford was silently delighted:—all had turned out for the best. It was evident Lord Maurice had procured the box for Gertrude, who a short time since, had expressed a wish to see that first-rate performer, Malibran; and perhaps he intended to avail himself of that opportunity to offer her his hand.</p>

  <p>Six o&rsquo;clock came,—no Lady Caroline; half past six,—seven,—still she tarried; at last Lady Woodford lost all patience, and began dinner. Seeing there was no chance of her coming, she sent her a note explaining the case, and begging her to follow them to the theatre as soon as possible. The first act of Fidelio was over, when they arrived, and in a short time Lord Maurice entered, accompanied by Lady Woodford&rsquo;s <i>bête noir</i> Count Alberti, and Lord Ramsay. To her great horror, the Count seated himself by Gertrude, and Lord Maurice by Sara; in vain she fidgetted from place to place, complaining that here she could not see; that there the foot lights came in her eyes, and that such a draft came from the stage, she was certain she should have a stiff neck; but with all her manœuvres she could not detach the Count from Gertrude&rsquo;s side. The second act began, and the beautiful acting and singing of Malibran rivetted every eye, and silenced every murmur. Notwithstanding the effect Schroeder Devrient produced in the part of Fidelio, impartial critics have declared that Malibran has made the character quite her own. The tender, impassioned manner, in which she exclaimed, &ldquo;I am his wife!&rdquo; produced an almost electric effect upon the audience, who rewarded the efforts of this accomplished and fascinating singer, with thunders of applause. At the end of the opera, Lady Caroline Brudenell arrived, with a whole string of excuses and apologies; said her coach had been nearly broken,—that she had mistaken the dinner-hour,—thanked Lord Maurice for inviting her,—and hoped the opera would begin soon. Her vexation was great on hearing it was over, as she preferred Malibran a thousand times to Grisi.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But tell me, Gertrude, who is that bowing to you on the opposite side of the house? I am so blind, I cannot see?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! it is Lady Elverton and her daughters; I must go.and see them,&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Maurice, darting out of the box, before Lady Woodford could prevent him, and it was with feelings of regret, but of a different sort, that Sara and herself beheld him seat himself next to Lady Amelia.</p>

  <p>Lady Woodford&rsquo;s temper was spoilt for the night, and not even the return of Lord Maurice some time after, could restore her former good humour; every thing had gone wrong. Lady Caroline flirted unusually with Lord Ramsay; Sara looked distracted; Gertrude appeared perfectly unconscious of any one&rsquo;s presence but Count Alberti. Henry Morley declared the afterpiece was wretched stuff, and that he should go and see if Lady Elverton would ask him to supper. Lady Woodford complained of a violent head-ache, and giving the signal of departure, retired very ill-satisfied with the evening, and fully convinced that the anticipation of a pleasure is often greater than the enjoyment of the reality. The next morning, at breakfast. Lady Woodford informed Gertrude she was much displeased with her behaviour of the night before. &ldquo;The Count is nothing but a common adventurer, and who knows but what he may have been a shoe-maker in Italy. It really is too bad wasting your time on one, who only courts you because he thinks you have money; but I now tell you, I never will give you one shilling if you marry that man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Woodford was completely silenced when Gertrude replied, &ldquo;I do not think it very probable that Lord Maurice would be on such intimate terms with the Count, if he were of such low origin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The post came in, and a letter from her husband concealed Lady Woodford&rsquo;s embarrassment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your father is coming to town the beginning of next week, and intends staying for the ball, which I think is quite unnecessary; he knows no one, and people will be asking who he is. Oh, dear! this is very dreadful! The ship Sidney Wells went out to India in, has been wrecked, and all on board perished; his father is dead of grief, and the three girls are left perfect beggars.&rdquo; A loud sob from Gertrude interrupted Lady Woodford, who looking up, perceived her rushing from the room, crying violently. &ldquo;For goodness sake, Sara, go and see what has happened to your sister, really she has grown so very odd lately!&rdquo; Sara did not wait another summons, and found Gertrude weeping most bitterly in her room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dearest Gertrude, what is the matter, are you unwell? tell me what I can do to relieve your distress.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gertrude only replied by loud sobs, which seemed to shake her very frame; but at last, soothed by the kindness of her sister, she related her interview with Sidney Wells and her refusal of him. &ldquo;Yet if I had accepted him, I should have been most guilty, loving another as I do. Start not, Sara, at what I tell you; I never can marry any one but Count Alberti. Yet, see the utter hopelessness of my love; my mother detests him. Oh, Sidney! the wrong I did thee, is doubly repaid by my present sufferings; but to think I have been the cause of two persons&rsquo; death, whom I so esteemed, oh, it is madness! The name of murderer is now branded on my forehead; his orphan daughters; his sisters stand before me, and accuse me of their loss; the sea will cast up its victim to appear in judgment,—all will unite to destroy me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is useless exciting yourself so much, Gertrude, you are not to blame; be assured, you never could have married Sidney Wells; in every respect he was unfit to be your husband; do not therefore accuse yourself of his death. Poor Fanny Wells and her sisters must be in great affliction at being deprived of their father, whom they loved so dearly; and without friends,—what will become of them? But in the midst of trouble, hope will shine through and lighten our cares. Before we came to town, papa gave me two hundred pounds; half of it is untouched; suppose then, dear sister, we send this privately to them, it will at least serve for present necessities.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh Sara! how every thing reproaches me. My father gave me the same sum, and it is all squandered. I fear to ask my mother for more, as she might inquire the cause, and reproach me for my foolishness.&rdquo; Gertrude felt too unwell to go to the opera that night, but begged her mother and Sara would attend. The latter went with the cheerfulness arising from having performed a good action; for, immediately after her conversation with Gertrude, she had forwarded the money to the Miss Wells, with a very kind letter signed &ldquo;A true Friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Woodford attributed her eldest daughter&rsquo;s sudden indisposition to the conversation they had had about Count Alberti, and blamed herself for being so harsh. They found Lady Caroline Brudenell established in the opera box with Lord Ramsay, who was so enrapt gazing at the fair creature he was speaking to, that he did not perceive Lady Woodford&rsquo;s entrance till the shutting of the door roused him from his agreeable <i>tête à tête</i>. Lady Caroline was full of kind inquiries about Gertrude; fancied her headache proceeded from the heat of the theatre the night before, and gave a whole list of remedies that had been prescribed for her. This was all said in a hurried and unconnected manner, and though her flushed cheeks, and sparkling eyes were sufficient signs of something extraordinary having taken place, Lady Woodford never for a moment imagined the truth. A suspicion flashed across her mind that Lady Caroline might wish to marry Lord Ramsay, but she was confident he would never think of sacrificing himself to a person thirteen years his senior. Yet, during the evening, he never once quitted her side, and though numerous visiters came, he never retired till Lady Caroline was handed to her carriage by him.</p>

  <p>Sara&rsquo;s wandering eye perceived Lord Maurice established in Lady Elverton&rsquo;s box, and fancied he only spoke to Lady Amelia; but she might be mistaken. On leaving the opera, Lady Woodford heard Lord Maurice say in reply to some question, &ldquo;Oh! it is Lady Woodford&rsquo;s youngest daughter; is she not lovely? but...&rdquo; she heard no more, for the noise of the footmen, mingled with the shouts of link boys, rendered such a thing impossible. By that single &ldquo;but&rdquo; she concluded, Lord Maurice meant to declare his preference for Gertrude, and was satisfied. Sara heard the speech, as the deep blush it called up plainly showed. The link boy to all his speeches of &ldquo;Bless your honour, and the young lady; sure you&rsquo;ll not forget poor Jack,&rdquo; had no reply, save the elevation of the window glass with a jirk so sudden, that it threatened instant destruction to the clear crystal.</p>

  <p>Gertrude was sufficiently recovered the next day to accompany her mother and sister to that fashionahle resort of a Sunday, the Zoological Gardens. Lady Woodford was a subscriber, and was passing in when Lady Caroline Brudenell ran after her, dragging Lord Ramsay by the arm, and begging for a ticket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I have endured, standing here for more than an hour, with the broiling sun on my head; and really the people are so rude, pushing forward, that I am bruised all over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, my dear Caroline, but I have only three tickets for the girls and myself; but Henry is a subscriber, and perhaps can assist you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Henry Morley was solicited, but he had already promised them to two friends he was to pass in. Poor Lady Caroline was in an agony. At last, after waiting another hour, and suffering her feet to be trod upon, her chip hat,—Devy&rsquo;s last make,—knocked in at the side of the crown, and her canzou, worth at least sixteen guineas, torn by the means of a descending parasol,—a person, who appeared to be a retired grocer, or of that calibre, kindly released her from her troubles, by giving her two tickets. Lady Woodford, in the meantime, had been vainly trying to obtain a seat in the gardens, and at last was obliged to content herself with leaning against the iron chains that encircled the monkeys&rsquo; cages. On all sides she was assailed with, &ldquo;Lady Woodford, will you allow me to introduce a very great friend of mine to you, who is particularly anxious to go to your ball;&rdquo; and forthwith, bows were made, introductions gone through, and invitations given, before Lady Woodford, who was getting quite bewildered, discovered that her daughters were not with her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! you need not be at all anxious about your girls,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Keith, coming up with four of her own, &ldquo;for I just met them walking with Lord Maurice, who I think will take every care of them, as I hear he is soon to be very nearly allied with your family.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Woodford put on a very mysterious pleased look, and was preparing to answer, when Mrs. Keith again broke forth:—</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the bye, my dear Lady Woodford, I have a great favour to request. You know Mr. Turnor, don&rsquo;t you? Well, your daughters must; he is in the eighty-seventh, and the most agreeable man I am acquainted with. Will you invite him to your ball? He will be such an acquisition, for he is such a good dancer; and to tell the truth, I think he is desperately in love with my eldest daughter Ann; but unfortunately, we go out of town next week; yours is the only ball we are invited to, and if I cannot get him to propose there, all hope is over, as he goes to India next month.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Woodford, who had carried invitations about her for a month, gave Mrs. Keith one, making the reflection that the ball would be filled with every one&rsquo;s friends but her own. Lady Caroline Brudenell had invited two hundred people; the Elvertons had asked what they termed sixty dancing men, all fit for action, being neither blind, lame, deaf, or dumb. Her son had invited fifty of his friends, and the number of invitations given to strangers, to her daughters&rsquo; partners, with five or six old friends of her own, amounted to one hundred and fifty more. Gertrude and Sara joined her, with Lord Maurice, and Count Alberti. Lady Woodford contented herself with coldly bowing to the latter, and greeting the former cordially, for the speech of the previous night was fresh in her mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is Henry walking with?&rdquo; asked Lady Woodford, of her daughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sure I do not know; I have seen them often before,&rdquo; replied Gertrude, &ldquo;but I dare say Lady Caroline can tell us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; exclaimed she, coming up with Lord Ramsay, who looked nearly as tired as herself; &ldquo;it is the great beauty every one is raving about. I have asked her to your ball, for she is quite the &lsquo;ton.&rsquo; People have taken her and her mother up amazingly, since they have become so rich. You have heard of Mr. Parker Williamson, the wholesale linen-draper?—well, this is his daughter: he died two years ago, and left her all his property, and the world says your son is soon to marry her.&rdquo; Lady Woodford stood aghast at this information; the idea that the house of Morley should ever be allied to a possessor of the plebeian name of Williamson: oh! it was too much for her to endure. Lady Caroline perceived the shaft had reached its destined place, and was satisfied.</p>

  <p>The long wished-for day of the ball at length arrived, and Lady Woodford&rsquo;s house, in Park Lane, was undergoing every necessary preparation. Lord Woodford came by the stage-coach to town, but his wife was too busy to heed him. He embraced his daughters affectionately, and was much struck with Sara&rsquo;s altered appearance; she had always been very delicate, but now seemed half the size she was on her leaving the country. Sara declared she felt perfectly well, but rather fatigued by the constant dissipation. To change the subject, she inquired after the Miss Wells&rsquo;s, and both were delighted to hear they were staying at Hornby Castle.</p>

  <p>Gertrude went with a gayer heart than usual to dress for the ball, at which she anticipated such pleasure: the Miss Wells&rsquo;s were safe under her father&rsquo;s roof, and there, she was sure, they would ever find a warm welcome. One ball is like another, all are equally entertaining to those who are happy: but Lady Woodford had never before felt so miserable. Every one congratulated her on Gertrude&rsquo;s approaching marriage with Count Alberti. Her son was devoted to Miss Parker Williamson, Lord Ramsay to Lady Caroline Brudenell; and though she had beforehand informed Lord Woodford how she wished the parties to be coupled, he seemed to forward the present state of affairs, by getting introduced to Miss Parker Williamson, and encouraging Count Alberti in speaking to Gertrude. Mrs. Keith was in high glee; Mr. Turner had proposed to her daughter; the wedding was to take place immediately, for he did not intend selling out of the army, and they were going to India: Ann, perhaps, would be tempted to take her sister with her as a companion, and who knew but what she might get a husband there, and then there would be only two left to provide for. Lady Woodford had to bear all this tirade with patience, and was congratulating Mrs. Keith on the intended match, when a crash from below spell-bound every tongue. The cause was soon known:—Mrs. Parker Williamson had been sitting in the supper room, on the edge of a small table, covered with china plates and dishes;. the weight had proved too much for its strength, and Mrs. Parker Williamson found herself suddenly seated on the ground, with strawberries, cotelets, the remains of hot and cold chickens, white soups, dishes, tureens, &amp;c. &amp;c., strewed promiscuously over her person. All endeavours to extricate her were for some time fruitless, and when, at last, the task was accomplished, it was as much as Lord Woodford and his son could do, to prevent themselves from laughing at the extraordinary sight she presented. The body of a fowl hung by a claw to her sleeve, the bows on her dress were crammed with peaches, potatoes, &amp;c., her gloves and arms were alternately crimson and white, from the mixture of strawberries, soup, and cream, with which they were covered; not a part of her dress was free from the supper she had so amply shared, and as she proceeded to Lady Woodford&rsquo;s dressing-room, accompanied by her daughter, and Miss Morley, the gravy and soup kept dripping from her dress all the way. Lady Woodford was in agonies at this misfortune: she dreaded seeing a flaming account of it, with the vulgar name of the principal performer, in the Morning Post, or Court Journal; besides, the report was circulating, that Mrs. Parker Williamson had been indulging rather too freely in a certain rose-colour sparkling drink, which was said to be the cause of the accident. &ldquo;This comes,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;of letting other people invite the company. Lady Caroline shall answer for this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The morrow came, and with anxious trepidation: Lady Woodford sent for the Morning Post into her dressing-room, to read the account of her ball. It took up one whole column, and was headed by, &ldquo;Lady Woodford&rsquo;s grand ball, in Park Lane.—Last night, Lady Woodford&rsquo;s house, in Park Lane, presented a gay and brilliant scene; her ladyship gave her first grand ball this season, on which occasion, the whole of her splendid mansion was thrown open to receive all the rank, beauty, and fashion, in London.&rdquo; Then followed a long description of the suite of apartments, the spacious dancing-room, the well-filled conservatory, the lofty hall, &amp;c. &amp;c., which Lady Woodford found very difficult to believe was the house in which she resided, so much had the paper enlarged and added to it. &ldquo;The Miss Morleys were, however, the attraction of the evening; these young ladies are said to be as amiable and accomplished as they are lovely. We regret to state that the festivities of the evening terminated with an accident, that has every appearance of being fatal in the end. Miss Parker Williamson, a young lady of great personal attractions, was leaning against the supper table, when, owing to some unforeseen chance, the table gave way, and the unfortunate individual was nearly covered with the things on it. A gold candelabra fell on Miss Parker Williamson&rsquo;s head, and, we hear, fractured her skull. The unhappy lady was carried, insensible, from the room, and the first medical assistance procured, but no hope of her recovery is entertained. What makes the occurrence more distressing, is, that Miss Parker Williamson was about to be united to the only son of the noble host, a very promising young man, of five-and-twenty; his distress may more easily be imagined than described: the greatest apprehension is entertained for his intellects, so deeply has this circumstance affected him.&rdquo;—Three weeks passed by; Miss Parker Williamson had recovered from her accident, and was as noisy and vulgar as ever. Lady Woodford and her daughters had been to every party given, and heard, with much regret, Lord Woodford intended they should leave town in a short time. Lady Woodford rebelled strongly against this determination, but to no avail; her husband was getting much alarmed at Sara&rsquo;s altered looks, and fancied country air would be of benefit to her. London was thinning rapidly, Lady Elverton and the Lady Barnetts were gone to Leamington, Lord Maurice had left town. Lady Kirton was at Brighton, Mrs. Turnor had sailed with her husband, and the whole regiment of the eighty-seventh, to India. Mrs. Keith had pursued a young Scotch laird to the Highlands, in the hope that he would be tempted to share his castle, situated on a bleak hill, with her third daughter, Wilhelmina, who raved about Scotch riband, Scotch music, Scotch pebbles, Scotch vales, Scotch mountains; in short, a Scotch husband. Louisa Walton was still in town, and dined at Lady Woodford&rsquo;s as often as possible. Lord Woodford, who was famous for taking up people, declared she was the cleverest person he had ever met with, and was a valuable acquisition to their family party. &ldquo;It is astonishing,&rdquo; said Lady Woodford, one morning, to her husband and daughters, as they were seated at breakfast, &ldquo;the number of marriages there have been this year, and yet not one in my family.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Gertrude, summoning up courage to divulge the important secret; &ldquo;but I hope soon to see my name among the list of brides. I have deferred informing you, mamma, till I had my father&rsquo;s sanction to the match I am about to make, and I now announce that I hope shortly to present m husband to you, in the shape of Count Alberti.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Count Alberti!&rdquo; shrieked Lady Woodford; &ldquo;oh heavens! is it possible?—no, no, never shall it be, never will I call him son, never shall he be your husband:—Lord Woodford, will you so far forget your rank, your connexions, your title, every thing! as to let a common adventurer, a base fortune-hunter, a vile hypocrite, be allied with your family.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady Woodford, do you remember the contents of these bills?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This simple question had an astonishing effect on. her ladyship, whose violent rage settled into a calm, quiet ill-humour, and she took up the newspaper to conceal her vexation, for the amount of the bill just mentioned was four thousand pounds, which she had squandered, during her residence in the metropolis. &ldquo;Merciful Powers!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Woodford, half starting from her seat; &ldquo;who could have foretold this? Listen: &lsquo;Marriage in high life.—Married, on Tuesday last, at Leamington, the Earl of Maurice to Lady Amelia Barnett, daughter to the late, and sister to the present Earl of Elverton; the ceremony was performed by the—&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sara!&rdquo; cried Gertrude, as stretching forward, she received her sister fainting in her arms. All was consternation; none knew the cause of her sudden illness: Lord Woodford feared the worst, and bitterly reproached himself for not having taken her from London when he first came up. Doctors were summoned, Sara was conveyed to her apartment, and maids ran in confusion from room to room, gathering smelling-bottles, but in reality doing nothing. Lady Woodford and Gertrude hung over Sara in agony, first rubbing her cold hands, and then applying restoratives.</p>

  <p class="sep">* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was on a bright day at the end of Autumn, that a bridal party stood before the altar of St. George&rsquo;s Church, Hanover Square. The couple about to be united in one, were both young and handsome. The friends were few that stood on either side of the sacred spot, and but one bride&rsquo;s-maid attended; slender and emaciated was her form, a hectic flush shone on her wasted cheek,—that person was Sara Morley! who now officiated as bride&rsquo;s-maid to her sister. For three months she had wavered betwixt life and death, and when strength again, in a small portion, revisited her frame, she begged her sister&rsquo;s marriage might take place. The ceremony was performed, and Gertrude was made the happy wife of Count Alberti. The new married couple repaired to Hornby Castle, where they intended passing the honey moon. Gertrude would have preferred any other place, for she dreaded revisiting the spot where last she had seen him who was no more; but the precarious state of Sara&rsquo;s health, deterred her from contradicting the arrangement. A week after Gertrude&rsquo;s marriage, Lord and Lady Woodford set off for Hastings, with Sara, as the mild air of that delightful place was particularly recommended by the faculty, for her disorder; and when her father perceived a delicate pink tint her pale cheek, he returned humble thanks to the Almighty, for restoring his loved child to health. The Miss Wells had left Hornby Castle on a visit to an old uncle of their mother&rsquo;s, who had begged them to come and cheer his solitude, and thereby Gertrude was spared an interview, which would have been most painful to both parties. A short time after her arrival there, she wrote the following letter to her sister; the characters therein were unsteady, and showed that the agitation the writer laboured under was extreme.</p>

  <p>Dearest Sara,</p>

  <p>While I write, I can scarce believe my senses. Sidney Wells is not dead!—I have seen him: but oh! how changed. Yet my heart has been relieved of a weight that was too heavy for any one to bear. Yes: I have beheld him; I have heard his voice; dare I say it, once more has he breathed the avowal of his love to me. I fear to tell my husband. Counsel me, dearest sister, what to do. Sidney Wells is fearfully altered: I met him in the gardens, and was nearly overcome with surprise, at so unexpected a meeting. He has evidently suffered much; and his escape, when the ship was wrecked, seems almost miraculous. His manner is so wild and distracted, that I dread leaving the house, for fear of meeting him.—When he mentioned Alberti&rsquo;s name, it was said in a voice, and accompanied by a look I shall never forget. Sara, I am certain he is at times deprived of reason, every thing tells of madness. We think of going to Hastings in a fortnight,—I only wish the time was come; I long to see you. I have not been hasty in my choice of a husband; Alberti is more than I deserve, he is all love, tenderness, and goodness towards me. Adieu, dearest sister; I hope to see you quite recovered, and possessing all your former spirits. Believe me, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

  <p>Gertrude.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sara was daily sinking under her malady, and it was evident no art could prolong her short life. Gertrude attended her constantly, and tried every expedient to relieve her inward cares, for some private distress seemed to weigh on her mind. &ldquo;Gertrude, much as I love you, I must refrain from imparting my secret to you; a few days will pass, and it will no longer be hid; betray it not, dearest Gertrude, it will startle you; but I have concealed it long, and though the serpent has stung the breast in which it was nestled, still have I cherished it, and pressing it still closer to my aching heart, so will I die. I know it is wrong, and have been to blame, in giving my thoughts up to an object that never could be aught to me; but you will feel for one, who is more to be pitied than chided. Here is the key of my desk:—when all is over, the cause of my illness will be revealed to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In a week, the mournful tolling of the church bell announced that there was one inhabitant less in the world,—that person was the young and beautiful Sara Morley: her gentle spirit had fled, prepared to rest in the presence of her Heavenly Father. A simple tomb-stone, in the church-yard at Hastings, marks where her body reposes, free from the cares of this life. With a trembling hand, Gertrude unlocked her late sister&rsquo;s desk: the first thing her eyes rested on, was a slight pencil sketch, blistered, and nearly effaced with tears: it was of Lord Maurice. Underneath was written, in a feeble hand, the following lines:</p>

  <p class="stanza">&ldquo;Mine is a love that ne&rsquo;er can be repaid,<br />
  Yet though &rsquo;tis hopeless, it will never fade;<br />
  Concealed from all the world, inwrapped shall lie<br />
  Within my heart,—so cherished till I die.</p>

  <p class="stanza">And wilt thou shed a tear, when I&rsquo;m no more,<br />
  And o&rsquo;er my grave thy tender laments pour?<br />
  Or wilt thou grieve that one so young should die,<br />
  And in the cold, dark vault, forgotten, lie?</p>

  <p class="stanza">Ah! no; for thou must never fully learn,<br />
  This unrevealed flame, which fierce doth burn,<br />
  Unwept, unheeded, shall that love decay,<br />
  As doth the cestus, at the close of day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The unhappy Sidney Wells, after Gertrude&rsquo;s departure from Hornby Castle, hurried away by a love he could neither gratify nor check, once more embarked on the wide ocean, and sailed for America, where, by the labour of his hands, he managed to support, for a few years, his wretched existence. Lady Caroline Brudenell married Lord Ramsay, but never lived to enjoy the title of countess. Lord Woodford, after his youngest daughter&rsquo;s death, sunk into an apathetic state, which nothing but Gertrude&rsquo;s presence could in any ways overcome. Lady Woodford, perfectly unnerved by the late calamity, never mentioned London, except to abuse it in the strongest terms. She offered the Miss Wells a home under her roof, and, shortly after, her son married Elizabeth Wells.—Thus endeth Lady Woodford&rsquo;s arduous task of</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Match Making.&rdquo;</p>
