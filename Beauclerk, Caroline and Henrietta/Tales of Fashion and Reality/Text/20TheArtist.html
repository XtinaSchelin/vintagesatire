  <p class="stanza">&ldquo;But as he fondly snatched the wreath of Fame,<br />
  The spectre Poverty unnerv&rsquo;d his frame:<br />
  Cold was her grasp, a withering scoat she wore,<br />
  And Hope&rsquo;s soft energies were felt no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class="smallCap">In</span> the year 1830, Charles Murray, a young artist of great promise, undertook the task of walking through the southern counties of England, in hopes of finding scenes he could immortalize by the power of his pencil. In his wanderings after nature, he became acquainted with Mary Seaford, the only daughter and heiress of a rich country squire. Miss Seaford&rsquo;s company proved so attractive to the young painter, that July, August, and September, passed away, and still he lingered in Hampshire. Mr. Seaford was a generous, warm-hearted old man, and loved his daughter with all the affection of a doating parent; she was the last remaining child of six, who had all died before they reached the age of twelve, and on her, all his generosity and love were lavished. After the demise of his first wife, thinking his child would require the kindness and attention of a mother, he determined on marrying again; he wished, if possible, to meet with a person a few years younger than himself, and possessing a good, even temper. Numerous were the ladies pointed out to him, as gifted with every good quality; amongst others, Miss Letitia Sharply was strongly recommended to his notice. Her friends and relations were unanimous in praises of her amiable disposition, excellent qualities, and kind and generous heart. In some unlucky hour, Mr. Seaford proposed, and was accepted. Mrs. Seaford&rsquo;s enemies said she was many years his senior, and that there were very good reasons for her never having entered the matrimonial state. A man who is bold enough to marry an old maid, it must be acknowledged, deserves a better fate than what is generally in store for him.</p>

  <p>It is to be supposed that a person who has arrived at the age of forty, without one offer, however indifferent, must possess some very great fault, which not all the artifice in the world can conceal. It was so with Mrs. Seaford; her sweet temper was in reality ungovernable, and never before had any one tendered her their fortunes or person. Poor Mr. Seaford discovered, but too late, the rashness of his choice; alas! the Gordian knot was tied, and he had not the power of Alexander to sever it.</p>

  <p>Mary Seaford had attained the age of seventeen, when Charles Murray first became acquainted with her. The young artist&rsquo;s appearance was always joyfully hailed by her and her father, and each succeeding day endeared him more closely to them.—Mrs. Seaford hated Mary, and did not strive in the least to conceal her dislike from her husband; she was for ever declaring that nothing but her affection for him could make her live with Mary, for her disposition was insupportable. Poor Mr. Seaford feared to contradict his wife in the slightest thing, or even to take his daughter&rsquo;s part; he often found Mary in tears, and learnt with pain they were occasioned by her step-mother&rsquo;s ill-nature and abuse of her.</p>

  <p>The young painter&rsquo;s visits grew every time longer, till at length, while superintending his lovely pupil&rsquo;s drawing, the passion so long concealed within his own bosom, broke forth, and Mary promised to become his for ever.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of my father&rsquo;s consent, I am certain; he loves me too fondly to refuse the only request I have ever made to him. To-morrow, then, we will seek him, and together receive his blessing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>How frequently are our most sanguine expectations blasted! The morrow came, and with it, intelligence which nearly broke the heart of the gentle Mary. Mr. Seaford was found dead in his bed; the physician was summoned, and he decided his death was caused by apoplexy. Mary was refused the consolation of once more gazing on the body of her beloved parent; for Mrs. Seaford had ordered that no one should enter his apartments,—and to prevent the possibility of such a thing, she locked the door, and retained the key. Mary wept in silence; every thing recalled the affectionate father she had lost. Alone, she sat in the room where last she had seen him; there was his chair, and on the table near it, the book he had read but eight hours before his death. She approached the table; her portrait was there with her age and name written under it by himself. A letter, half-finished, was on the writing-book, it was ordering some fancy article which the day before she had expressed a wish to possess. At this fresh proof of his past affection, her tears fell fast, and she hastily left the room, to indulge in the luxury of unforbidden grief. The day of the funeral arrived, and Mr. Seaford&rsquo;s remains were deposited in their last resting-place. Contrary to custom, Mrs. and Miss Seaford attended. The ceremony was often interrupted by the sobs and shrieks of his &ldquo;affectionate&rdquo; widow, who, throwing herself down by the side of the coffin, declared her determination never to leave it. All the strangers pitied Mrs. Seaford, praised her affection, and ended by declaring that Miss Seaford did not appear to care much for her late father. Many of the spectators, however, marked the difference in their grief, and whilst they abused the hypocrisy of the one, commended the simple and suppressed, yet deep sorrow of the other.</p>

  <p>The day after the funeral, Mrs. Seaford, attired in deep mourning, assembled all the relations of the deceased, and in their presence, her husband&rsquo;s will was read; when, to their great surprise, they learned that Mr. Seaford had left the whole of his property, both landed and funded, to his disconsolate widow. Mary&rsquo;s consternation may easily be imagined; her father had always said, that he intended leaving her all he possessed, with the exception of eight hundred pounds a-year to her step-mother.—But now that his will was read, not a remembrance, not a token of affection, not the smallest sum, had he bequeathed her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If Mary had known what was to have been her lot in future years, she would have wept more than she did, at the state of utter dependence she was left in. Months rolled on, and time, which softens every woe, had lulled the natural, and deep felt grief of Miss Seaford. Charles Murray, after the death of his old friend, was obliged to return to London, to attend the division of a small sum that had been left between himself and two distant relations. Some time elapsed, and he was once more a visiter in Hampshire. There was something in Mrs. Seaford&rsquo;s manner towards him, which was remarkably forward and disagreeable. Mary appeared much out of spirits; she had grown thinner, and her once sparkling eye was dim with weeping. For mere formality sake, Charles determined asking Mrs. Seaford&rsquo;s consent to his marriage with Mary, and for this especial purpose, he requested an interview with her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am aware, Mr. Murray, of the proposal you are about to make; but I think the intercourse you have had with the world, must point out to you, the impropriety of declaring it so soon after the demise of Mr. Seaford. I can only attribute this to the ardour of your attachment. Defer then, for a year, urging your suit, and I promise you that after that time, it shall not be refused.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There can be no impropriety, madam,&rdquo; replied Charles Murray, &ldquo;in my marrying—&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold, Murray!—However I might feel inclined, in this case, what would the world say to my becoming another&rsquo;s wife, when my late husband has only been buried six months?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The present case is perfectly different: I knew not even there was a question of your marrying again. Mary has been—&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Villain, wretch, monster of iniquity! oh, where can I find a name vile enough to call you by!—see here the proof of your baseness:—these letters, wherein you have called me by the most tender names, shall be brought in evidence against you.—Can you deny it?—is not this your own writing?—Think not that by marrying Mary you will get <i>one</i> shilling:—she is penniless, and entirely dependant on my bounty.—You never <em>shall</em> be her husband!&rdquo; and with a look of mingled hate and fury, she unlocked her desk, and drew from it several papers and letters. The epistle she now showed him, was one he had written to Mary, a week before he had quitted London; but to his great surprise, her name had been eradicated, and Letitia, (Mrs. Seaford&rsquo;s,) inserted in its place; it had been so skilfully managed, that no trace of a former name having been there could be seen, or even the mark of a pen-knife. Murray remained astonished. He saw it was useless declaring the letters had been written to Mary, for he had to contend with one, who cared not what falsehoods she uttered. Among the papers in the desk, he discerned a yellow-looking parchment, with a seal affixed to it. He seized hold of it, and glancing rapidly over the contents, he saw it commenced with: &ldquo;I hereby will all my property to Mary Seaford:&rdquo; before he had time to continue, Mrs. Seaford snatched it from his hands, and committed this testimony of the deceit she had practised on her step-daughter to the flames. &ldquo;Woman!—have you dared to substitute a forged will in the place of Mr. Seaford&rsquo;s, and dispossessed his daughter of her rightful property?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Murray,—I will have no further intercourse with you:—leave my house, this instant, and marry that canting hypocrite, Mary Seaford; from this hour my home shall be no home for her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the course of a week, the injured heiress and Charles Murray were made one by holy rite. His exertions were redoubled to get employment, but, alas! he could find none. The whole of his small income became, in a short space of time, exhausted. His cousins had denied his right to any share of the legacy, and the lawyer, in whose hands he had placed his cause, after losing it, had brought him in a bill, which the whole amount of his slender fortune barely paid. Day and night he laboured, and though his productions were equal to any of the other young artists, yet his drawings had no sale. Mary saw, with great alarm, that the hue of health had forsaken his cheek, his eyes were sunken and dim, and a severe cough had settled on his chest: daily he became weaker, and his trembling hand was unable longer to guide the pencil. He rejected all Mary&rsquo;s earnest entreaties to see a doctor, saying, &ldquo;they had not that money to throw away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Consider, dearest, your health: surely it is more valuable to me than any thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mary,—you know not the state of utter ruin in which I am involved. We have been married a year, and not one farthing of our rent has been paid. My bills are numerous: I owe fifty pounds to the person who has furnished me with materials for painting; none of our household bills have ever been discharged, for I have not had wherewith to pay them. I fear to leave the house, for my creditors would surely seize me. What are we to do? I have put them off from day to day, and they will wait no longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will apply to Mrs. Seaward; surely she will not refuse to help us in our distress.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband, as the blood mantled high on his pallid cheek; &ldquo;never shall you be placed in a situation by me, to be insulted by that woman,—I care not for myself, but that you should be sacrificed so young, and have to fight against poverty; oh, it is indeed hard!—If you had only some friends with whom you could live, I should be happier.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>^&lt;Leave you, Charles!—never. Have I not sworn to stay with you in sickness and in healthy and now that the ills of life are gathering thick over our heads, should I be the first to leave you?—oh, never!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Another six months passed by, and Charles Murray was stretched on the bed of death.—&ldquo;Is there no hope, Mary?—will he not give me the smallest sum for it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas, no!&rdquo; replied she, while her tears fell fast; &ldquo;he says be could not dispose of it again, and that he should lose whatever he gave me for it. His chief objection was, that the picture is not half finished. I told him the state you were in.... Oh, God!—he smiled! and said my story—might—be false.&rdquo; Sobs choked her utterance, and the unhappy creature sank, exhausted, by the side of the mattrass, on which her husband lay.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weep not for me, dearest,&rdquo; said he, in a voice scarcely audible; &ldquo;my sufferings must soon cease.—I shall speedily prove another victim to that disease, for which there is no remedy. You are young, and beautiful; Heaven grant you may find friends!—Have you not a crust of bread wherewith I could satisfy these cravings of the body?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas!—not one morsel!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Those who have never <i>felt</i> poverty, understand not the meaning of the word. The rich, the wealthy, know not the agony of wanting even the plainest food necessary for the sustenance of life, which one piece of that dross they daily squander, in useless frivolities, would serve to procure. The happy mother, surrounded by every luxury that can be obtained, while smiling on her child, thinks not how many parents there are, who scarcely dare gaze on their suffering offspring, for fear of seeing famine marked on every feature, and to hear their cry for bread, when she has none to give them. Such were Mary&rsquo;s feelings; she would have knelt to her bitterest enemy, and prayed them to give her the smallest piece of money, that she might procure her husband food, and would bitterly reproach herself that she had brought all this upon him; for through her love, he was reduced to starvation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Withdraw the window curtain quickly, Mary, that I may catch a last glimpse of the glorious setting sun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a trembling hand she obeyed. The raw cold evening breeze blew in, in gusts. The sick man attempted to rise on his pallet,—the exertion was too much for his feeble constitution;—a hollow cough, that sure omen of consumption, burst from his lips, and as he sank back, exhausted, the crimson blood gushed through his mouth, and dyed the bed coverings. Mary screamed aloud; she had never before witnessed a sight so terrrible:—she paused not; in a minute she had rushed from the room, down the dark narrow staircase, and stood in the apartment belonging to the mistress of the house. &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; shrieked the distracted wife.—No one was there to answer her call, but there was that on the table, which fixed her gaze, like an enchantment,—it was gold!—she clasped her throbbing brow,—the temptation was strong,—one piece of that ore would perhaps save her husband&rsquo;s life. Money was in her grasp, and yet she dare not seize it. The recollection of the dying emaciated form of her husband, flashed across her mind:—she hesitated no longer, and in an instant a piece of that envied gold was firmly clutched in her hand. But the action was not unwitnessed; the owner of the apartment had entered, and beheld the transaction, and before night had cast its shade over the universe, Mary Murray was the inmate of a prison.</p>

  <p>In a fortnight she was appointed to take her trial, as Mrs. Clayton could not be dissuaded from prosecuting her penniless victim. The fatal day arrived, and Mary stood before her judges; but what a difference had a fortnight made in her appearance: deep-felt shame and anguish, was now added to the look of want and misery she had before; her large eyes were sunk with weeping, and half-closed; for guilt hung heavy on that fair brow, which before, had never harboured any wrongful thought Mrs. Clayton being the only person who had witnessed the theft, the examination was not long ere it was brought to a close. Mary heeded not the trial; her mind was wandering far away; and when the judge addressed her with &ldquo;Prisoner! guilty, or not guilty?&rdquo; the crimson blood rushed to her face; as calmly raising her head, and shaking back the dark hair that shaded it, she replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Guilty!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On being advised by the judge to plead &ldquo;not guilty,&rdquo; she exclaimed:—</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you have me add a falsehood to my other crime, and so bring down the charge of cowardice and deceit on my head? No; I will not deny it, I am guilty. My husband was dying, I entered Mrs. Clayton&rsquo;s room; Heaven is my witness, it was only to seek assistance; she was not there. I was about to quit, when my eyes fell on some money near me. That very morning Mrs. Clayton had refused to lend me one shilling. To all my prayers and supplications she lent a deaf ear, and even threatened to turn my dying husband out of the miserable garret we inhabited, if I did not raise money enough to discharge the rent which was due. Distracted, I offered some of my husband&rsquo;s sketches for sale, (his drawings had all been seized,) and every where, they declined giving me the smallest trifle for them. Nothing was left but starvation. I saw the money; the evil one possessed me; I could not resist the temptation, and took a sovereign. It was not for myself, but for one for whom I have suffered much, and would still more, if it could restore him to health; but for pity&rsquo;s sake, let me go to him. Oh God! if he be already dead!&rdquo; and the scalding tears gushed through her bony fingers, as she pressed them to her face.</p>

  <p>A murmur of compassion rose in the court, mingled with one or two sobs from the female spectators.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You say you are married, and yet you have no wedding ring; where is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas! it is gone! I pawned it a month ago for two shillings, to buy my husband a blanket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You might have spared yourself that trouble and expense,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Clayton, &rdquo;your husband, as you call him, is dead and buried. I thought he could not last long when I saw him the night you went to prison; for he took it sore to heart.&rdquo; The last part of her speech was unheard by Mary, who with a piercing scream fell heavily on the floor.</p>

  <p>The jury, after some deliberation, returned a verdict of guilty, and the prisoner was sentenced to be imprisoned for twelve months. When the sentence was repeated to Mary, she exhibited no signs of grief; she could weep no more; the sources of her heart were dried up; the world to her now, was but a blank canvass,—the form that once animated that space, being expunged. The being for whom she had sacrificed every thing, was no more. Decayed and senseless was the idol of her heart; she had nought to live for—and in three weeks, her body rested in the dust from whence it came.</p>
