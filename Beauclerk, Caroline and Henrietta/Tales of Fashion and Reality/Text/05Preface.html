  <h1>PREFACE.</h1>

  <p><span class="smallCap">Portraiture</span> is the peculiar talent of the English;—the delineation of outward form engages the dull; lineal tracings of manners, or careful shading of deep passion absorbs the intellectual portion of our artists, and our writers: the same taste pervades the whole nation—that is, the great body of readers and of gazers. What, indeed, can be more interesting than sketches from nature, that forcibly display the national characteristics of our own time, our own peculiarities of station and of habits, with the effects of circumstances and individual propensity?</p>

  <p>The easy <i>nonchalance</i> of manner, together with the high-sounding phraseology of the world of fashion; the flurried awkwardness or affected pomp of the <i>parvenu</i>; the cautious modesty of the middle classes; the wayward fleetings, the sturdy obstinacy, or the humble pliancy of deportment in various portions of the lower grades of society, are but so many outward symptoms of varied cultivation, or of different graftings on the great crab-stock of human nature: to mark its indications, and trace its progress under particular circumstances, has been the object of the writers of this little volume, and they hope that in spite of the inequalities or imperfections incidental to a first production, their living panorama will prove at once amusing and useful.</p>

  <p>To indicate what they consider the beauties of the book, would be impertinent; to dwell on what they may think effective passages, amusing anecdotes, or touching incidents, would not at all become them, however the public may expect in this preface a pompous full-length miniature of the work itself. When huge folios or ponderous quartos were in fashion, such summary proceedings were not only allowable, but really necessary: even now when a sufficient likeness is preserved, it may be very praiseworthy, to enable us, by such a contrivance, to obtain an insight into the contents of three or four substantial octavos, enough for the purposes of general conversation; but in the case of a small duodecimo like this, it is not too much to hope that the book itself will be read, and its merits fairly balanced against its weaker points. If it be found to contain correct information on interesting subjects, that knowledge of fashionable society that its scenes require, and occasional aptness at description, a favourable verdict will no doubt be recorded by an intelligent public, which will be an ample reward for the labour and anxieties of the authoresses.</p>
