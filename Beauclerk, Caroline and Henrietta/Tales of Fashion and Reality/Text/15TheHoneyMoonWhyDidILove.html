  <h1>THE HONEY MOON;</h1>

  <p>OR</p>

  <p>WHY DID I LOVE?</p>

  <p>BY CAROLINE FREDERICA BEAUCLERK.</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="smaller">&ldquo;Passion blinds our eyes, and the light which experience fires is a lantern on the stern, which shines only on the waves behind us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><i>Coleridge&rsquo;s Table Talk.</i></p>
  <hr />

  <p class="stanza">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis breathed in vain—<br />
  Thy sophistry of love!—<br />
  Though not in pride or cold disdain<br />
  Thy <i>falsehood</i> I reprove!—<br />
  Inly my heart may bleed—but yet<br />
  Mine is no weak—no vain regret;<br />
  Thy wrongs to me I might forget—<br />
  But not to Him above.</p>

  <p class="stanza">The tie so firmly bound<br />
  Is torn asunder now,<br />
  How deep that sudden wrench may wound<br />
  It recks not to avow.<br />
  Go thou to fortune and to fame—<br />
  I sink to sorrow—suffering—shame—<br />
  Yet think, when glory gilds thy name<br />
  I would not be as thou.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="smaller">The passions are the chief destroyers of our peace—the storms and tempests of the moral world.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>No question requires more mature deliberation answer than that of,—Why did I love? Most foolish causes have produced a feeling between the sexes called <i>une tendresse</i>, which often rushes headlong into an affection of the heart, by the generality named love; by the ascetic, &ldquo;youth&rsquo;s frenzy;&rdquo; and by the desperate, idolatry! It is the opinion of a modern author that a woman always thinks it right to fall in love with a man whom she has seen in his night-cap. Ruminating on the oddity of such a proceeding, I was roused from my reverie by hearing pronounced in an audible voice, &ldquo;I, Algernon Clarendon, take thee, Fanny Rochfort, to my wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer.&rdquo; I then remembered that I was at a marriage, performed by special license, and officiating as bridesmaid to Lady Fanny Rochfort, the prettiest and most fashionable girl in London, who was now perpetrating that rashest of all desperate acts—marrying for love. I will now relate the incidents which followed this wedding, with a short account of the parties concerned.</p>

  <p>Fanny Rochfort was beautiful and nobly born. Her hand had been demanded in marriage by many of the greatest <i>parti&rsquo;s</i> of the day; but Fanny looked coldly on coronets, and frowned on heirs-apparent. Of an ardent and romantic turn of disposition, she had formed the resolution of remaining single till she had won a young, fresh heart like her own,—one &ldquo;that Cupid had not toyed with.&rdquo; Lady Fanny declared she would never wed another&rsquo;s leavings!</p>

  <p>Algernon Clarendon was a young man just emancipated from Oxford—extremely handsome—of good family, but very poor. Having waltzed with Lady Fanny three times, and paraded for a week on horseback by her barouche, with his white-gloved hand on her carriage door, concluded by a proposal of marriage in the Zoological Gardens. Lady Fanny paused for a moment, and began industriously digging up the gravel with her parasol. At lengthy to the infinite joy of her Adonis-like lover, her pretty lips faltered forth—&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; exhorted Lady Rochfort, &ldquo;Mr. Clarendon has but the beggarly revenue of three hundred a-year, and I tell you frankly, that owing to your large family of brothers and sisters, I cannot afford to give you any fortune. In am beset on all sides by creditors—ruin and disgrace stare us in the face;—your father <em>will</em> keep race-horses, your brothers <em>will</em> gamble, your sisters must be educated, and I <em>must</em> wear diamonds. We glitter, but, alas! we are not gold!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; responded the love sick Fanny,—her sapphire eyes swimming in tears,—&ldquo;never shall it be said that I renounced the idol of my heart through mercenary motives! With what feelings of disgust shall I look on the world, when I am with Algernon in our cottage <i>ornée</i> in the country. Dear Algernon! adoring thee as I do before marriage, my heart must burst from overflowing love, when placed at the pinnacle, the very apex of human happiness,—I call thee—husband!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But much as Fanny idolized her lover, she refused to wed him till after the expiration of a twelve-month; thus putting the duration of his affection and fidelity to the test. When that period had terminated, to the satisfaction of both parties, the wedding day was fixed. The trousseau was ordered, a handsome chariot was built, Fanny hinted her partiality to a diamond comb and a pearl necklace, but Algernon said, &ldquo;No, my angel, let a rose alone adorn thy beauteous hair, and leave it to antiquated dames to hide their scaly, roach-like necks with pearls.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Fanny thought of Abélard and Héloise, and answered—&ldquo;Be it so—I shall be prouder of wearing thee, than all the treasures of Golconda mines.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The ceremony was performed—they were married.</p>

  <p>Fanny looked at her wedding ring, and felt quite proud at being a wife. She then changed her blonde dress for a white satin travelling pelisse, which she thought would be useful to her in the country. The chariot with four horses, and postilions with bridal favours, drove to the door; the smart maid established in the dicky. Fanny turned pale, and tears gushed from her eyes.—&ldquo;Good bye, mamma.—good bye, papa!&rdquo; and she tripped down stairs through a file of menials, repeating—&ldquo;God bless you, my lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fanny rushed into the carriage, for she felt as if she must have swooned away on the pavement; and throwing her head on Algernon&rsquo;s shoulder, she wept bitterly. Clarendon kissed away his bride&rsquo;s pearly tears, and Fanny smiled again, and assured him, it was the excess of love she bore him that had been too much for her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How happy we shall be in each other&rsquo;s love in the country,&rdquo; said Algernon, &rdquo;without any of the world&rsquo;s petty cares and trivial amusements. &rsquo;Tis true, we shall be poor, very poor, but rational beings require not lucre. Seneca says, &lsquo;If you live according to the dictates of nature you will never be poor: if according to the notions of the world, you will never be rich.&rsquo; The house which I purpose making our home is a small parsonage. I have a sister married to a clergyman, and finding the glebe-house too small for their numerous family, they have removed to another residence in the vicinity, and have let me the parsonage at 30<i>l</i>., per annum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, enchanting!&rdquo; replied Fanny, &ldquo;what a delicious thing to fall into:—your sister, no doubt, a most exemplary clergyman&rsquo;s wife—dear kind hearted woman, who nurses the sick; and oh, Algernon! how I shall doat on her darling children!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Converse like this beguiled the way till after having travelled eighty miles, they passed through a small village with a parish church. They then drove up a narrow lane. The shades of night were descending, but through the dusky evening gloom, a house one story high was visible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can they mean by stopping at such a cutthroat looking place?&rdquo; asked Fanny.</p>

  <p>But before her husband could reply, a woman threw open the carriage door, and with a sharp shrill voice said, &ldquo;Welcome to the parsonage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Fanny. Clarendon hurried her into a low room, the sole furniture of which was a table covered with a cloth and two mould candles. Fanny saw her husband embraced by a sharp thin faced woman, who called him brother. Next a vulgar looking man in parsonic (Qy. rusty?) black, shook him violently by the hand, and then she saw her dear Clarendon kissed and slobbered by seven dirty little children; and, finally, Algernon presented his lovely young bride. Lady Fanny Clarendon, to her new sister-in-law, Mrs. Ramsden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty head you&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ramsden to her brother, &ldquo;you never ordered a bit of dinner; so I have hired a charwoman and told her to boil a leg of pork. Do you like pork?&rdquo; turning to Lady Fanny, who groaned faintly; while Mrs. Ramsden, who piqued herself on telling the honest truth, which means taking a savage delight in wounding one&rsquo;s feelings, said, in a loud whisper to the agitated bridegroom, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought us a nice coil—a genuine fine lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The leg of pork, garnished with potatos and greens, was now brought in by the old charwoman. But though Lady Fanny seated herself next to her husband at the dinner table, she could not satisfy her delicate appetite with the homely fare before her. The Ramsdens, however, set to, and all seemed tolerably cheerful, save poor Fanny, who sat pale and tearful, averting her head from Mrs. Ramsden, on whom she looked as a tigress.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A glass of mulled wine. Lady Fanny?&rdquo; said Mr. Ramsden. She replied not, but rising from her seat, was gazing with eye-balls strained, clasped hands, and parted lips, on the further side of the dimly lighted room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo; exclaimed Algernon. A loud scream was the answer, and she fell lifeless on the floor. Clarendon carried the insensible girl up to her bedroom, where at last she revived only to relapse into violent hysterics. When the paroxysm had subsided, she fell into a state of torpor, and Algernon having left her in charge of her maid, Mrs. Sanders, returned to his relatives below. The distracted husband now discovered that young Jack Ramsden had pulled aside a black curtain which fell before a niche in the wall, and had thus disclosed to view a large human skeleton, which was fixed in a glass frame. Mrs. Ramsden spoke very unfeelingly on poor Fanny&rsquo;s alarm, remarking, that she, herself, always lived in a room filled with skeletons without curtains to conceal them.*</p>

  <p class="smaller">* Let this be not thought over-drawn: people soon accustom themselves to horrors in the country. I know a gentleman who always sleeps with a miniature coffin placed on his pillow every night. He brought me one day a small coffin made of black satin and lined with white, and on my refusing it, he said, &ldquo;Why, you might keep your rings in it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The following morning Algernon&rsquo;s heart yearned with pity, as he gazed on his bride, when she entered the breakfast parlour. Her cheek vied with the dead white of her muslin robe. Still she looked lovely, for it only enhanced the ruby tint of her full lip. Fanny was indeed too fair and fragile a being to endure the privations attendant on poverty, and Clarendon discovered too late, that a poor man should marry a bustling, strong minded, healthy, active and thrifty woman. Ah! thought he, let people without a farthing, before they tie the indissoluble knot of marriage, weigh well the poverty they must buffet against—the cuts, scorns, and rebuffs they will encounter—the starvation and rags in which they will most probably have to witness their progeny. If the portionless girl, about to wed a man equally poor, were to reflect for a moment, could she think it a happiness she bestowed on her lover to marry and become two paupers? thus hurling the objects of her affections down a precipice of ruin—shame—beggary! See these lovers ten years hence. Where are there protestations, their vows of adoration?—Gone! and reproaches, altercations, tatters, and scanty fare, are the sorry substitute. A man may, and I know many scions of the aristocracy who do &lsquo;rough it&rsquo; on two hundred a-year; but a wife is an expensive incumbrance to maintain. Your love may be an angel, still she must eat, drink, and be clothed. Oh! indeed, it is a cruelty to subject a man to such misery and perdition. &ldquo;Love flies when poverty enters.&rdquo; To be <i>happy</i> in the wedded state there must be <i>de quoi</i>, to provide a comfortable house, a sufficient dinner, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Clarendon&rsquo;s musings were interrupted by Lady Fanny, who, in a helpless tone of voice said, &ldquo;I want some breakfast.&rdquo; Algernon nearly rung the bell off, and loudly ordered &ldquo;breakfast!&rdquo; In a few moments, Mrs. Sanders, looking blacker than an impending thunder storm, or ten legions of demons, appeared loaded with a tray, spread on which was a metal tea-pot, brown sugar in ajar, and a couple of wedgewood cups and saucers. Lady Fanny declared she could not drink tea sweetened with molasses,—it was the counterpart of a black dose; and said she had sooner starve than eat salt butter, which she could only compare to cart grease. A violent altercation was now heard in the passage, in which the voices of Mesdames Ramsden and Sanders rose in <i>soprano alto</i>. The latter rushed into Lady Fanny&rsquo;s presence and announced her intention of immediately quitting her ladyship&rsquo;s service, Mrs. Ramsden having told her, it was her duty to help to dust the house, and also to make her mistress&rsquo;s bed. This Mrs. Sanders swore, she never would submit to.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leave me, then,&rdquo; murmured the trembling Fanny.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leave the house!&rdquo; vociferated the indignant Clarendon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;House! cottage—hovel—hut!&rdquo; screamed the enraged Abigail, flouncing from the room, and banging the door to.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Till you get another soubrette,&rdquo; said Algernon, &ldquo;an orphan cousin of mine shall wait upon you,—Zoé Forester will make us a delightful companion; she is a dear little thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These words grated unpleasantly on Lady Fanny&rsquo;s tympanum, and she was thinking Clarendon&rsquo;s remark <i>un peu libertin</i>—when in stalked Mrs. Ramsden, looking very angry and red, followed by Zoé, a pretty, blue eyed, long ringletted, little sylph, who presented Lady Fanny with some strawberries.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, eat them,&rdquo; said odious Mrs. Ramsden, &ldquo;our garden, though small, is fruitful, which we attribute to its having once been part of a churchyard; in digging we constantly find skulls and bones.&rdquo; Fanny turned quite sick, and pushed away the produce of dead men&rsquo;s carcasses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How I long for my phaeton!&rdquo; sighed Fanny.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We always make use of our legs in these parts,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Ramsden, displaying at the same time a pair thick enough to be useful, instead of ornamental, not to mention a foot as large as the marble model at Mr. Hope&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>Clarendon, after a long and earnest conversation with Miss Forester, which Lady Fanny vainly tried to catch the purport of, led his cousin from the room. Lady Fanny rose to follow them, when Mrs. Ramsden said, &ldquo;I beg your ladyship will remain here.&rdquo; The request was unheeded,—Fanny caught a glimpse of Zoe&rsquo;s white dress, as she was entering an arbour in the garden. Clarendon then had a secret to communicate, and excluded his wife from his confidence! As these suspicions flashed through her brain, she threw up the window, leaped out, and arrived breathless at the bower; she was about to enter, but drew back, near fainting with horror as she heard Clarendon say, &ldquo;Never repeat this to Lady Fanny, the consequences might prove fatal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Zoé wept, and replied, &ldquo;I never will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Algernon continued, &ldquo;I consider it right, now that I have wedded another, to part with the tress of my first love&rsquo;s hair,—wear it, dear Zoé, for my sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took a locket from his bosom, and kissing it fervently, gave it to Zoé. The tears of both flowed, when suddenly the stillness was rent, by a scream so loud, so shrill, it appeared super-human. At the sight of Lady Fanny, Zoé fled, and Clarendon stood confronted with his wife.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! not one word,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;thy downcast eyes which read the ground,—thy loudly beating heart, reveal thy guilt, thy falsehood to me. Thou lovest; but, oh, my God! thy wife is not the object of thy love.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; said Clarendon; &ldquo;thou reignest paramount in my heart!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast no heart!&rdquo; replied the infuriated wife; &ldquo;or if thou hast, it is a foul deformed thing, unsound as carrion, untrue as lovers&rsquo; vows. A thing of doughy which every fool may lay his finger on and leave an impress there! Oh, Clarendon! the horror, the disgrace, that overwhelms me at coming to the knowledge of being thy second love, will send me into my grave!&rdquo; Saying this, she rushed from him, flew to her room, and fastened the door. In vain did Algernon try to force it open, in vain he conjured her to inform him in what he had displeased her. It was not till five o&rsquo;clock that she appeared again down stairs. Clarendon then said:—</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fanny, is this the conduct of a woman who swore even unto her Maker to love, honour, and obey the man her virgin heart selected as the partner of her life?&rdquo; He ceased, for he was shocked, at perceiving the ravages that grief had worn in her beautiful face.</p>

  <p>The Ramsdens gave, this day, <i>un diner de nôce</i>; and at Clarendon&rsquo;s entreaty. Lady Fanny consented to accompany him. Zoé performed the duties of lady&rsquo;s maid to the bride, who received her services in the most ungracious manner; but Zoé bore her ill temper with the greatest sweetness and gentleness. Lady Fanny was at length dressed, and in all the pomp of beauty and fashion, entered Mrs. Ramsden&rsquo;s drawing-room.</p>

  <p>Passing through-an assembled circle of natives, all <i>à la gobemôuche</i>, Clarendon was arrested in his progress, by a stout, manly-looking woman, in a flame-coloured gown and turban. This walking scarlet-fever was presented to Lady Fanny, as Lady Skipsey, who instantly thrust forth her husband, Sir Jacob, and her daughter, Miss Skipsey, who was &ldquo;coming out,&rdquo; at the ensuing assize-ball. Lady Fanny thought &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; a <i>mal à propos</i> term for a country miss, whose pleasure and ambition consisted in romping a Roger de Coverly with a fox-hunting squire, or country bumpkin, at those terrestial pandemoniums yclept county-balls!</p>

  <p>Lady Skipsey was the wife of a brazier, who indented a brass pen, warranted to write by itself; and as the present is the <i>brass</i>, not the &ldquo;golden age,&rdquo; the ingenious mechanic was rewarded by being dubbed Sir Jacob Skipsey.</p>

  <p>Another Ostrogoth was next presented in the person of a Mr. Baxter, who instantly fired off with, &ldquo;London very gay?&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the icy reply. &ldquo;I know a great friend of your Ladyship&rsquo;s,—Mrs. Todlikins; charming woman, full of life and dash, yet her wit is never at the expense of her gentility; does your ladyship <em>attend</em> her squeezes?—difficult to get a ticket for them,—uncommonly select.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Fanny was now approached by Mr. Ramsden, with his arm like a bent skewer, into which she locked her fairy hand, and having begged of Clarendon to keep near her, led the way to dinner. Fanny having had neither dinner nor breakfast since her wedding, felt famished, but was forced to refuse attempting white soup, which resembled hot paste, and fiery sherry which scraped her throat. When ihe called to mind the récherché dinners of her own dear home, how <em>could</em> she touch the ill-dressed fare before her, which consisted of shoulder of mutton and onion-sauce—minced beef and poached egg.—hash, with a sauce the colour of London mud—tongue in the shape of a cupid, its wings made of parsnip, and its face of a white turnip-radish. Fanny longed for <i>une soupe santé à la pastorelle,—torse de chevreuil mariné d la Saint Hubert,—un arliquinade de goles et merlins à la financière,—des filets de chapons de Caen à l&rsquo;Italienne</i>. As a last resource she turned to the side-board; but instead of <i>hure de sanglier, cardon au beurre d&rsquo;anchois à la Sefton,</i> or <i>bourtaga</i>,—cold beef, and Gloster cheese met her famished eye. Clarendon, who for the last year had been daily in the habit of dining at Lord Rochfort&rsquo;s table, felt equally disappointed; Sauterne, Bourdeaux, and Hermitage, those three indispensable necessaries being at a discount. The health of the bride was proposed after dinner in a &ldquo;neat speech,&rdquo;—&ldquo;three times three!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What wine will your ladyship take? Champaign?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gooseberry wine to Lady Fanny,&rdquo; ordered with an authoritative tone, Mrs. Ramsden; and with amazement and horror, Fanny saw her glass filled with a white liquid. &ldquo;It is excellent, I assure you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ramsden—&ldquo;infinitely superior to champaign.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A loud shriek from Fanny, followed with the ejaculation of &ldquo;I am poisoned!&rdquo; caused general alarm; but Mrs. Ramsden never lost her presence of mind, and put an end to the confusion and panic, by tasting the effusion, and informing Lady Fanny, who was wishing Algernon farewell for ever, that she was not poisoned, but had <em>merely</em> swallowed a glass of Epsom salts, which by some mistake had been given. &ldquo;It will do you all the good in the world,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Ramsden; &ldquo;my children take a glass daily before dinner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dinner over, Lady Fanny had to endure the martyrdom of hearing the ladies sing English ballads. Oh! what is so deplorable as the performances in <i>general</i> of amateurs. Piano-forte, harp, flute, violin, and voice, belong legitimately to Herz, Bochsa, Nicholson, De Bériot, and Malibran. Dreadful are they when strummed, twanged, squeaked, screeched, and squalled upon by unscientific, conceited, and inflated amateurs. Fanny occupied herself by writing the following to Lady Rochfort:</p>

  <p><span class="smallCap">&ldquo;My dear mamma,</span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;I left you yesterday, anticipating the most delightful honeymoon that bride ever spent; but every hour of my married state ha» brought the most extraordinary and dreadful calamities. Even as I write, my heart feels bursting with anguish, for oh! I have discovered that Algernon loved, before he married me, his cousin Zoé Forester. This duplicity has well nigh killed me, for you know how often he has sworn that I was his <em>first</em> and <em>only</em> love;—<em>this</em> was my inducement for wedding one objected to by my family, he being bereft of title and fortune. Pray, dear mamma, send me the Morning Post regularly, and also my little spaniel. I thought I should not require a thing to fondle, when once I had a husband. Ah! Algernon little knows the devoted heart he is trampling on. Really, at this moment, I could administer with pleasure a dose of arsenic to that hated Zoé Forester. Expect to see me in a day or two.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your affectionate, and heart-broken</p>

  <p><span class="smallCap">&ldquo;Fanny Clarendon.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p>Tea and the men came in, and Mr. Baxter persecuted Lady Fanny till she wished him dangling in the air at Tyburn. He was a lawyer walking the circuit: a character which the fair Thalia of our day has described so well in her "Almack&rsquo;s Comic Song,&rdquo; and Fanny indeed found that</p>

  <p class="stanza">&ldquo;Those very grave judges, do tell one great fudges!<br />
  The small talk of big wigs, is woefully small,<br />
  And the stale circuit jokes may amuse country folks,<br />
  But no counsel shall plead them for me at a ball.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A cup of bohea, Lady Fanny?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Baxter.—&ldquo;Shall I cream you?—has your ladyship any idea of going to the assize ball? If you have any idea of dancing—may I presume to be the happy man?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no ideas about any thing,&rdquo; answered Fanny, snappishly.—Baxter might have quoted Voltaire's saying, that ideas are like beards,—women have none!</p>

  <p>Zoé was asked to sing; and, unlike young ladies who are always suddenly attacked (poor things!) by sore throats, &amp;c., when solicited to perform, Zoé struck her guitar, and sang that most lovely and thrilling ballad, &ldquo;Love not!&rdquo; Her voice faltered, and tears glistened in her dove-like eyes, as she came to the words of &ldquo;Love not,—the thing you love may die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Fanny kept repeating in a querulous voice, &ldquo;Algernon take me away!&rdquo; Clarendon was shocked at her rudeness,—he felt deeply grieved at her misery, and already reproached himself for having transplanted this fair flower from the hot bed of luxury to such a ploughField of clods, in which she seemed drooping like a dying lily. Lady Fanny at length declared she would remain no longer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only one moment, dearest,&rdquo; said Clarendon: &ldquo;I must sing a duett with Zoé.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fanny walked straight up to the piano,—ungovernable rage had usurped so complete an empire over her as to transform her naturally mild countenance, into one resembling a fallen angel&rsquo;s. She twisted Zoé round by the arm, and cried, &ldquo;You shall not!—by Heaven! I would sooner expire than hear her sing with you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clarendon&rsquo;s eyes gleamed like a basilisk&rsquo;s; but suppressing his anger and emotion, he led, or rather carried. Lady Fanny from the room. The scene was dreadful and violent that ensued.—Lady Fanny vowed on her knees, that if Clarendon ever spoke again to Zoé she would return to her parents, and leave him for ever.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kill me!—kill me!&rdquo; urged the headstrong girl; &ldquo;but for pity&rsquo;s sake let not the fangs of jealousy begnaw my very soul away!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So help me God!&rdquo; swore the distracted husband, &ldquo;I do not,—never did, love Zoé Forester; how basely you wrong that spotless maiden! &rsquo;Tis beyond my power to display to you the full extent of your ungenerous accusation, and the wickedness of your insane behaviour. The wretch shows not more folly when surrounded by the dying and the dead in the time of plague;—he cries, Avaunt! grim spectre! What though the poison is fiercely burning in his veins, and innumerable plague-spots appear on his brow?—he braves Heaven&rsquo;s wrath, quaffs off intoxicating draughts,—basks in the radiance of dear woman&rsquo;s smile,—luxuriates in her soft embrace, and gives himself wholly up to maddening revelry. Infatuated as the worldling is, he is not guilty of a folly so incomparable as yours.—You might be happy as an angel, with an adoring husband who proffers thee the sparkling cup of happiness, which you dash away. Fanny!—Fanny!—I blush for you. Oh! remember it is only vitiated minds who are prone to think ill of others!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These words are idle, and meant to divert me from my purpose, Clarendon!&rdquo; screamed the frantic girl, as she clasped her hands round her husband&rsquo;s throat, so as to prevent him averting his head, while she fixed on him eyes, dazzling with unearthly lustre. &ldquo;Is it customary for a bridegroom to present a maiden with a locket? You tremble.—<em>You do love!</em> but not your wife, for whom your love is lawful,—deny it, if you dare; my own eyes gave me evidence that my husband was a perjurer,—a lying hypocrite, a dishonourable villain! Clarendon, the day is approaching when you will have to stand, side by side with me, at the tribunal of God, the bond-slave of an impure passion, the unabashed, undisguised vassal, of an unholy, sensual love. May God then have mercy on your soul! Oh, &rsquo;twas a hellish sprite, to give thy hand to one,—thy heart to another.—Clarendon! Clarendon! no more can I name thee lover, no more can I call thee husband;—bear, henceforth, the name of fiend!—ay, fiend with an adamantine heart! Oh, Great, Almighty, and all powerful Creator!&rdquo; continued Fanny, as kneeling on the ground she tore out large handfuls of her hair, and gnashed her teeth in frantic agony,—&ldquo;this is the punishment due to me, for having worshipped so intensely, so like a pagan, a mere mortal man.—I made an idol of my Algernon,—no longer mine, <em>her</em> Algernon. Woman! fond confiding woman! trust not that lying, false-hearted fiend named man. He sports with, then sickens of your love,—your adoration is turned into jest,—you are undone, and are driven unto madness. Oh! would that this hand which binds my aching side, were red-hot steel to sear my poor heart&rsquo;s core!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But why write the ravings of the wretched wife? Reason,—that heavenly sense which distinguishes man from brute, had fled from its beauteous tenement, and madness reigned;—life seemed ebbing fast from this angelic creature, and Algernon prayed for death to cease her agonizing writhings and excruciating tortures. Intense were the sufferings of the almost heart-broken husband to see his bride of a day stretched on the bed of death;—she who had borne him such deep and passionate love, now calling on heaven to curse Zoé and Algernon. The heavings of her snowy breast were suppressed by strappings of leather,—her exquisitely moulded arms were bruised and mangled by the strong graspings of the coarse hands of the village apothecary and the charwoman. Towards morning the sufferer ceased to rave; all around stood aghast, expecting death would release her from her mortal pangs. Tears trickled down the beholders&rsquo; cheeks,—the hardest heart must have softened at the sight of such appalling misery. Fanny at length opened her once beautiful eyes, now sunk in their sockets and glazed. She sat up in the bed, and looked attentively at each of the horror-struck beings who encircled her; she then took off a Venetian chain, which hung round her swan-like throat; at the end was affixed a small miniature; she gazed on it earnestly for a few moments, and said, &ldquo;Algernon! take back-thy portrait!&rdquo; Clarendon shrunk away, but Fanny handed the miniature to Zoé. She next drew off her wedding ring, and with surprising strength snapped it in twain. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a fatal gift!&rdquo; she murmured, as her head drooped on her bosom, and her tears flowed fast. These she quickly checked, and recovered her calmness.—Zoé now spoke:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You charge me with a heinous crime, and one of which I am innocent; you accuse me of loving your husband.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My life upon it,—&rsquo;tis false!&rdquo; burst forth Mrs. Ramsden: &ldquo;the goddess of chastity was not more virtuous than is that maiden;—you wrong Algernon most basely;—he burns with no impure ardour for Zoe. He loved <em>once</em>, as man never loved before; that woman was Zoé&rsquo;s sister; she was too good to remain in this world. It pleased Heaven to deprive Algernon of his betrothed;—she died,—she died!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The tress of hair was hers!&rdquo; sobbed out Zoé.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is still a deception!&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;Mark me!—I am not mad now!—shall not be again;—I do not love now,—never can again. Algernon Clarendon, rememberest thou the day I asked thee, if thy heart had <em>ever</em> worn love&rsquo;s fetters? thy answer rings yet in my ears, it was, &lsquo;Fanny, thou art my <em>first</em> and <em>only</em> love.&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;Then I promise to be thine.&rsquo; Thy falsehood has cost me dear.—the fault was mine. Why did I love? oh, Algernon!—Algernon! how totally for thyself was the idolatry, the intense love I bore thee! how I would have braved penury, scorn, disgrace, the world&rsquo;s contumely, all for thee, and should have spent a life of heavenly love, so thou had returned my adoration; but thou didst not. I am now dying—thank God for that! But Algernon!&rdquo; and her beautiful face beamed with brilliancy, and a scornful smile curved her mouth: &ldquo;Do not triumph in the idea that I depart this world with the foolish infatuation of still loving thee. No,—no,—I no longer love. Oh! again I thank thee, God, for that! All is not bitterness in this dark and solemn hour. Algernon Clarendon, farewell!— all—farewell!—may you meet with as peaceful a deathbed, as I have.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sank back on her pillow; Clarendon took her hand, which she forcibly and quickly withdrew from his grasp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not thy <em>first</em> love, Algernon!&rdquo;—She never spoke again,—her eyelids dropped,—all was over,—she was dead.</p>
