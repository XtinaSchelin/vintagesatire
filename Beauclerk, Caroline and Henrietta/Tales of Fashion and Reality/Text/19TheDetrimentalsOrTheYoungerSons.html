  <h1>THE DETRIMENTALS;</h1>

  <p>OR,</p>

  <p>THE YOUNGER SONS.</p>

  <p class="author">BY CAROLINE FREDERICA BEAUCLERK.</p>

  <p><span class="smallCap">Hard</span> is my doom, at each gay ball, to dance with every bore;<br />
  Papa, in anger says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flirt with the youngest son of four,<br />
  Never, my dear, engage yourself to that scamp, Harry Nevill,<br />
  When you galoppe with him, I own, I wish him at the devil!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Oh, dear papa! upbraid me not, and try your wrath to cool,<br />
  Lord * *&rsquo;s so deaf, Lord * * squints, and Lord * *&rsquo;s a downright fool;<br />
  Yes! I&rsquo;m resolved, that if you wish for talent, wit, or fun,<br />
  Always select at every ball, a <i>handsome</i> younger son!</p>

  <p>Lord Bullion, whom you wish your child, so very much to marry,<br />
  In stature only reaches to,â€”the elbows of my Harry;<br />
  At Richmond, too, with his great weight, he nearly sunk our boat,<br />
  Papa says, &ldquo;Better marry him, than a man with but one coat!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ne&rsquo;er shall valse with my consent with scampish detrimentals!&rdquo;<br />
  Is it in woman&rsquo;s heart to spurn Harry, in regimentals?<br />
  At each gay ball, I will maintain that in the general run,<br />
  The best of all nice partners is, a <i>handsome</i> younger son!</p>

  <p>For every throb that rends my heart, for my true love is beating;<br />
  The clouds that lour whene&rsquo;er we part, are banish&rsquo;d at one meeting;<br />
  The best, the kindest, truest heart, has my gallant lover Harry,<br />
  And though he is a younger son, him only will I marry.</p>
