  <p>AND</p>

  <p>THE PARRICIDE DAUGHTER.</p>

  <p class="stanza">&ldquo;If weakness may excuse,<br />
  What murderer,—what traitor,—<i>parricide</i>,<br />
  but may plead it?—<br />
  All wickedness is weakness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><i>Milton.</i></p>
  <hr />

  <p><span class="smallCap">&rsquo;Twas</span> night; and the busy hum of Madrid was now hushed in sleep, that universal queller of turbulent passions; leaving the town tranquil and silent as the grave. From one house, however, a blaze of light emanated, like virtue gleaming in golden beams on a benighted world, dark in sin and profligacy. At an open verandah of this brilliantly illumined palace, a youthful cavalier sat, seen in deep converse with a lady; and as the glare of light rested on her visage, her countenance resembled the whitest marble. Her eyes presented a deep and violet blue, a colour generally the concomitant of a snowy skin and scarlet lip; long silken locks of chesnut hue fell in negligent and heavy masses over her gracefully sloping shoulders, which, like unto alabaster in appearance, were marked here and there with lines of purple veiny tracery. Art and nature in this, a favoured child, had been competitors in giving grace and captivation to her charms. Pearls like Cleopatra&rsquo;s were pendant from each small round ear, and diamonds set in jet shot sparks of fire from the centre of her girdle. Her dress was of dark ruby velvet, as also the slippers which encased her tiny feet, and which latter were likewise studded with brilliants. The companion of one so lovely, was no less noble in his appearance. Although but a youth, evil passions had fixed upon his brow a fierce and brutal scowl; a deep cut and black eye, and a supercilious, nay, almost sardonic curve of mouth, had given him an aspect far from inviting, except to those who, blinded by Cupid&rsquo;s powers, look even upon blemishes as beauty spots. A balmy breath wafted the soft evening gale.—&rsquo;Twas the sigh of the beautiful maiden!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gaspar, thou art not angry with me?&rdquo; she said, while she averted her head to wipe away a falling tear. No answer was returned, but the maiden bending on her knee, imprinted a kiss on her lover&rsquo;s hand, and in a tremulous voice continued—&ldquo;How now, idol of my very soul! not one word! oh, Gaspar! wilt thou not believe what I have so often sworn, that spite of thy poverty I would wed thee; but my mother—&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold, woman!&rdquo; fiercely interrupted her lover; &ldquo;you are like all your sex; you fawn, you cringe, on titled, wealthy men. Be they idiots, be they devils, if the purse but chink, &rsquo;tis no matter what the heart of the possessor!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This from thee!&rdquo; answered the girl as she burst into a flood of tears; then quickly rising from her recumbent posture, while the flush of wounded pride drew a crimson mantle over her pallid face, she added, &ldquo;has love so swamped my woman&rsquo;s pride that I must e&rsquo;en kneel to man? I did forget me sadly! henceforth my bended knees, uplifted hands, and ardent prayers, to Heaven&rsquo;s high attribute shall alone be offered. Henceforth this foot, this small frail foot, which nobles have fallen before and madly worshipped, shall trample, shall stamp into the dust that vile, base crawling worm yclept man! Go forth, proud noble! proclaim to those who fawn and cringe on men, to learn from me the way to spurn and scoff at ye. All, all, a savage, devilish race! Gaspar, Gabrielle di Lorma bids thee farewell for ever!&rdquo; With flashing eye and quivering lip, the maiden strode haughtily away to the adjoining room. A crowd of gay gallants surrounded the beautiful Gabrielle, who soon was seen like a bright meteor, dashing through the mazes of the bolero. When she concluded, all flushed and panting from her exertions, she caught the sad and mournful gaze of Gaspar; but Gabrielle unmoved, linked her arm in that of the wealthy Due di Lorenzo, and passed Gaspar with a cold and fixed stare.</p>

  <p>Wound a woman&rsquo;s pride, and she ne&rsquo;er will bless the brutal hand that nipped the tender plant which flowers not again. Gaspar gnashed his teeth, his eyes rolled madly, as rushing from the house he fled rapidly through the deserted streets, and stopped not till almost breathless he fell exhausted on the ground.</p>

  <p>Frantic with despair, he beat his breast, he stormed, he raved. &ldquo;Oh, woman! woman! thou hast, like the fondled asp, dug thy venom-tooth into my bosom&rsquo;s core; but I will hazard all to win thee; by fair or hellish means, Gabrielle, thou shalt be mine. Oh! thou couldst ne&rsquo;er have loved me, for if thou hadst, thou wouldst have braved a parent&rsquo;s will.—What! spurn me because I cannot fling the wealth of Crœsus at thy feet! Hah!&rdquo; he continued, as if some plan had flashed across his brain; &ldquo;oh, I could worship the power that bestows on me such a thought; Gabrielle, thou <i>shalt</i> be mine!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gaspar slouched his plumed hat over his fevered brow, and wrapping himself up in his heavy mantle, walked hastily to a lone part of the town. The morning sun was just faintly beaming, like first love dawning in a virgin&rsquo;s breast. Gaspar descended a flight of steps which led to a cavern cut in a rock, and pressing a concealed spring, a trap-door flew open, and he leapt into a dungeon where the rays of daylight never found entrance. An antique brass lamp was suspended by a rope from the roof, but hardly served to light this gloomy abode, as the farthest parts were in total darkness. The masses of rock overhanging at each side of the lamp, appeared as if studded with precious stones, for the dank and humid dews hung in large drops on them, and reflected a variety of brilliant colours. Gaspar felt as if the icy hand of death had grasped him. Directly under the lamp a form reposed on the ground, closely wrapped in goats&rsquo; skins, the only part visible was a foot that seemed almost too small for use, and close by, a little black slipper, richly embroidered in silver. A faint shriek, followed by the exclamation of &ldquo;My own Gaspar!&rdquo; and the reposing form sprang up, and rushing towards the new comer, clasped him in her arms. The fillet which bound her head had fallen off, and her slight figure was completely shrouded by the profusion of hair which streamed down in glorious effulgence. This fairy-like being was the only daughter of the Spanish miser, Jerôme.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Caspar!&rdquo; said the lovely girl, and she clapped her hands in transport; &ldquo;angel, let me gaze on thee for ever!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush Juâna, I cannot bear thy trifling this night. Off girl! cling not so on me.&rdquo; Juâna fell at his feet like a crouching spaniel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me love, but seeing thee hath turned me mad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Gaspar impatiently; &ldquo;where is thy father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Talk not of my father,&rdquo; answered the girl; &ldquo;talk of our marriage, aye Gaspar, talk of <em>that</em>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold Juâna!&rdquo; said Gaspar; &ldquo;thy tongue is like a ceaseless clock. Is thy father now sleeping?—draw near, my own idol. Hard is thy fate, poor girl, immured in this horrid cell, starved by a miserly parent, who has, thou hast confessed, thousands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye, millions in his iron box,&rdquo; answered Juâna; &ldquo;but &rsquo;tis a turn-up of which death I die first, a broken heart or starvation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Juâna, thou shalt escape both. Do what I tell thee!—thou wilt?—Dear girl, thou shalt be happy,—thou shalt be my wife!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Gaspar! call me but <em>wife</em> and I will endure, joyfully endure, all the torments of hell, even unto damnation! Gaspar, let me but call thee <em>husband</em>! show me the way to escape, and on my bended knees by my very soul I&rsquo;ll swear to do it! Gaspar, look not so wild—thy gaze is killing me. What means that poniard? Ha, fiend! thou mean&rsquo;st to stab my father!—thou must not, canst not! Oh God! murder my poor old father! the deed is too damnable! Oh that hell were yawning at our feet, by Heaven I&rsquo;d hurl thee in!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Juâna would have fled, but Gaspar seized her by her long black hair, and pointing the dagger to her bosom said, &ldquo;This then to thy heart!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Juâna bared her lovely breast, and replied, &ldquo;Be merciful,—kill, oh kill me quickly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gaspar unmanned, brushed away the scalding tears that sprung forth abundantly, and said, &ldquo;Juâna, thou lovest me not—I was deceived.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Gaspar! I would do all I could for thee, but murder my father; the deed is too foul—too horrid! My head is whirling like a revolving wheel. Oh God! my heart, my heart!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gaspar clasped her to his breast, and adjured her by all a lover&rsquo;s fond endearing terms, to make him blest. At length, Juâna led the way to another part of the cave, where the old miser slept. She would have left Gaspar to do the deed alone, but he clutched her hard and bade her hold the lamp. Juâna saw Gaspar seize the old man by the arm—she heard her father murmur forth, &ldquo;I have no money—I am a miserable beggar—oh spare me!&rdquo; A scream almost rent Juâna&rsquo;s heart. A purple stream of blood trickled to her feet; her father lay weltering in his gore.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The key!&rdquo; said Gaspar, gruffly.</p>

  <p>Juâna raised the head of the corse, and amidst the bloody straw, found the key. Gaspar opened a large iron chest which contained nought but old bones, carrion meat, rotten eggs, and such refuse as old Jerôme had been in the habit of picking up in the streets, and which were his daily fare. With many exclamations of disgust, Gaspar cleared out the box, and at the bottom discovered a parchment, from which he read as follows:—&ldquo;In case I should die suddenly, or meet my death by unfair means, I write this will for the satisfaction of those who consign my carcass to the dust from whence it was formed. All the money I have saved, I have placed at Gusman&rsquo;s bank, for the benefit of my sisters, Mercia and Henriquetta, and their respective families. For my only daughter Juâna, I disinherit her and leave her without a maravido, as an ungrateful disobedient child, who lavishes her love on a profligate spendthrift heartless noble, by name Don Gaspar.&rdquo; The paper dropped from Gaspar&rsquo;s hand,—&ldquo;disinherited, no money!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh Gaspar! let us not wait for money, let us fly; let us endeavour to forget this horrid murder/'</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fly with <em>thee</em>, Juâna! with a <i>Parricide Daughter</i>! have the arms of a murderess coiled round my neck? <i>No</i>, woman! beautiful as thou art, there is not one of Satan&rsquo;s devils who does not bear a more heavenly impress than I see in thy gloating eye. Murderess! Parricide! approach not. Were I to fold thee to my bosom, to calcined cinders should I turn, seared to the very bone by sin! Wed thee, Juâna! sooner would I wed a cloven-footed fiend. Nought could be so loathsome to my eyes as thou, an impure maiden with hands imbrued in blood,—marry <em>thee</em>! &rsquo;twould be perdition,—hell! Wed <em>thee</em>! a merry tale forsooth! some day be murdered by my bride,—ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gaspar, thou lovest another; I know thou dost. For if for me alone thy love had burned, would such a mere puff have so blown out the flame? Ah, no! for well I know that he who really loves, can hold a torch e&rsquo;en to his mistress&rsquo; faults, and swear those are her virtues! Gaspar! better rot in the earth, and he the food for worms, than live to be accounted infamous. Yet that even I could have borne; nay more—eternal misery—a burning hell hereafter, so thou hadst called me <em>wife</em>. Oh, for pity&rsquo;s sake say not <em>no!</em> again, &rsquo;tis more than I can bear; better far to die,—and I can die but once,—than to live dishonoured!&rdquo; Juâna snatched the poniard which had stabbed her father, and which was still reeking with gouts of blood; plunging it into her bosom, she uttered—&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but a prick!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly two men rushed into the cavern, followed by a few of the neighbouring populace. A cry of horror escaped them as they found themselves standing in a pool of blood.—&ldquo;Young noble, we come to conduct thee to prison, on suspicion of murdering that old man.—Hearing cries of lament, we hastened hither, and find thee covered with blood, and the old miser butchered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; answered Don Gaspar, &ldquo;I am innocent.—Yonder maiden, who stands pale and trembling, is the guilty being.—See,—in her hand is clutched the murderous steel V^</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gaspar!&rdquo; shrieked Juâna,—the blood from her own wound flowed fast,—she tried to speak, but her tongue clave to her mouth;—she fell lifeless on the ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Away with her to prison!&rdquo; was Don Gaspar&rsquo;s order, as they bore the insensible, but still breathing girl, from the cavern.</p>

  <p class="sep">* * * * *</p>

  <p>On a bright summer&rsquo;s day, at the end of July, a numerous bridal train slowly proceeded up one of the principal streets in Madrid, leading to a large public square: the silvery sounds of the lute wafted on the hot breeze, mingled with the joyous laugh, and gladsome voices: silken banners of gaudy hue waved on high, and the richly scented tresses of the damsels shed their perfume around; liveried menials walked, on either side, vainly striving to keep off the admiring crowd, as they pressed forward to gaze on the lovely Donna Gabrielle di Lorma, who was now to be united to the handsomest noble in the land, Don Gaspar. The betrothed pair headed the procession, mounted on two snowy steeds, which ever and anon champing their golden bits, tossed their small heads in pride, and made the silver bells, closely studded on the reins, tinkle, almost to the measure of music. The luxuriant locks of Gabrielle were thickly plaited with pearls; here and there they were looped up with rubies and diamonds, a wreath of which gems encircled her fair brow; her robe was of white satin, embroidered in pearls; her slender and delicate waist was confined by a cordelière of brilliants; the small hand which held the rein, and checked the ardour of her prancing steed, was incased in a white glove, embroidered in silver, whilst the other held a large fan, composed of coloured feathers, for the purpose of shading her lovely visage from the sun. The radiant smiles she lavished on her bridegroom were unheeded, as, pale and melancholy, he rode, bearing his plumed beaver in his hand, and the thick, dark curls almost shading his care-worn brow. The two families followed, nobly mounted, and decked with all splendour.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the tones of the muffled drum were heard, and at the opening of a side street, a procession of soldiers mingled with the bridal cortège. A man followed, clothed in black, and masked, holding a hatchet in his hand: then came a small, and youthful female, habited in white, her feet bare, and her long, black hair, almost entirely covering her form, reached the ground; her lip was blanched, and her slight marked eyebrows were contracted by grief, but not a tear glistened on the lid of her Persian-cut eye. The crowd retreated. Some exclaimed, with horror, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the parricide daughter!&rdquo; whilst others shouted, with savage delight, &ldquo;On.—on to the execution!—Let her die!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a scream was heard, and Juâna, the criminal, was clinging, with enchained hands, to the bridle of Don Gaspar&rsquo;s steed.—&ldquo;Save me! save me!&rdquo; shrieked the maiden; &ldquo;I am not guilty.—Dear Caspar, have mercy!—let me not die!&rdquo; Terrified, he on whom she called answered not; the quick heaving of his bosom alone portrayed his feelings were acute. &ldquo;Oh! Gaspar!—as you hope for mercy hereafter, show some now to me.—Oh, God! must I then die?—Gaspar, <em>you</em> can save me!&rdquo; and the distracted girl had nearly sprung upon his horse, when two guards seized her, and lifting her in their arms, bore her to the place she had escaped from. &ldquo;One word,&rdquo; said Juâna, &ldquo;and I will offer no more resistance,—a few moments, and I shall cease to exist.—Gaspar!—if the prayers of a guilty wretch can avail with Him above, thy life will be a happy one;—but in the midst of joy, let not the recollection of the miser&rsquo;s daughter be entirely effaced: a few short moments, and this face, on which thou hast so often gazed, and pressed to thy lips, will be cast into the mire, and therein trampled on;—a few moments, and this broken heart will no more ache,—grief will then repose,—tears will then cease to flow,—and Juâna&rsquo;s name will be linked with that of Parricide!—But this weakness is now of no avail:—Gaspar!—art thou happy?—Does yon fair dame possess thy heart whole, and untouched?&rdquo; Gaspar bowed his head,—the Spanish girl, meekly folding her hands on her throbbing breast, while her tears flowed many and fast, added: &ldquo;Then Heaven be my witness, I die content.—Gaspar! dear idol of my fervent adoration, <em>thou</em> art happy!—&rsquo;Tis well.—It is not fit that I should live!—my sight would blast thy peace.—Farewell for ever! I die content!&rdquo; and murmuring an inward prayer, Juâna joined the escort, and proceeded to the scaffold, which was erected in the square. The bridal party maintained a solemn silence,—a tear glistened in the blue eye of the noble Donna Gabrielle, is she vainly essayed to unravel from Gaspar&rsquo;s look this mystery.—The rolling of the drum ceased,—the bridal train advanced through the square:—Gabrielle hid her face in her hands, and wept.</p>

  <p>A shout arose, and a black mass was seen coming towards Gaspar: for a minute the soft breeze suspended the floating mass over his head. The mob pressed forward to behold Juâna. Violent hootings, shouts, and execrations on the parricide daughter alarmed the steeds: Gaspar&rsquo;s became unmanageable, and as it tried to break forth, the floating mass fell on the horse and rider.—It was Juâna&rsquo;s hair, which had been cut from her small head, and thrown to the crowd.—Shrieks were heard, mingled with confused sounds of hooting and despair; and at the same moment that Juâna had ceased to exist, by means of the executioner&rsquo;s axe, Gabrielle was bending over the lifeless form of Gaspar:—he had been thrown from his horse, and killed!</p>

  <p>THE END.</p>
