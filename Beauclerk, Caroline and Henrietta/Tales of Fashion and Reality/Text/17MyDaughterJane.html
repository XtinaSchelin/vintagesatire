  <h1>MY DAUGHTER JANE.</h1>

  <p><span class="smallCap">The</span> men are so tormenting, oh, how I hate them all!<br />
  They never ask my daughter Jane, to dance at any ball.<br />
  With other girls, night after night, I see men round me prance;<br />
  In vain I laugh, and fret and say, how <i>Jane</i> would like to dance.</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Last Almack&rsquo;s ball, Jane looked so nice, dress&rsquo;d en coulenr de rose,<br />
  And yet I heard a chaperon say, &ldquo;That quiz has <i>such</i> a nose!&rdquo;<br />
  My daughter nearly swooned away, poor dear, she overheard<br />
  A vile fop add, &ldquo;I vow she squints, and has a long black beard!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Then next there came an odious miss, who said, &ldquo;You're very right,<br />
  Refusing ev&rsquo;ry dance to join, this hot and sultry night.&rdquo;<br />
  Jane then advised <i>her</i> not to valse or galoppe any more;<br />
  &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you quite forget, I&rsquo;m not quite thirty-four!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>For hours on a dull bench I sat, I ach&rsquo;d in every joint;<br />
  Tuft hunters all pursued their game, Jane could not make one <i>point</i>.<br />
  When she some dashing captains spied, stuff&rsquo;d out, and all great <i>dears</i>,<br />
  At least she thought so, till one said, &ldquo;By jove that old one lears!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Alas! poor Jane, she ne&rsquo;er can get an active dancing man;<br />
  They&rsquo;ll neither dance nor flirt with her, or e&rsquo;en pick up her fan.<br />
  Oh the men are so tormenting! they have riven my heart&rsquo;s core,<br />
  They&rsquo;ve turn&rsquo;d my daughter&rsquo;s hair quite gray, and she&rsquo;s but thirty-four!</p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p>Vainly, alas! does Isidore entwine her brow with lilies,<br />
  Since gentlemen prefer to romp, with girls like scampering fillies.<br />
  Deuce take them all! do what I will, they won&rsquo;t ask Jane to dance;<br />
  As partners she can ne&rsquo;er obtainâ€”of a <i>husband</i> Jane&rsquo;s no chance.</p>
