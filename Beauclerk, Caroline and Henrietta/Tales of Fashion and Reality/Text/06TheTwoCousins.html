  <p class="stanza">&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis love—and if not love,<br />
  Why then Idolatry! Ay, that&rsquo;s the name<br />
  To speak the broadest, deepest, strongest passion,<br />
  That ever woman&rsquo;s heart was borne away by.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>PARIS.</p>

  <p><span class="smallCap">At</span> the close of a cold day, at the latter end of November, in a miserable chamber of the lowest description of lodging-house in one of the Faux-bourgs of Paris, a young girl, apparently not twenty years of age, was kneeling by the side of an aged woman, whose features were contracted by the sharp pangs of approaching dissolution, as she lay extended on a bed of straw. The snow fell in flakes through the broken windows, nor was there any fire in this abode of misery. Darkness was just contended with by a small lamp, which the wind, blowing in gusts into the garret, threatened at every moment to extinguish. The young girl herself seemed to be insensible to all outward misery; her large dark eyes were uplifted to heaven in mute supplication; tears glistened on her pale cheeks, rendered still more ghastly by a profusion of hair, black as the raven&rsquo;s wing, which trailed along the floor in rich luxuriance; her hands were closely pressed on her heaving bosom, as if to still its tumultuous beatings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; gasped out the dying woman, &ldquo;a drop of water to cool my parched lips.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Marie rose from her kneeling posture, and flew to a broken jug, but the water was frozen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said the sufferer, &ldquo;I feel I have not many moments to linger in this anguish. Oh God! what torments are preparing for me in hell, with the devil and all his angels! I tremble, for, lo! they are at hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be comforted,&rdquo; answered the girl, who stood over her dying parent, in an agony of despair. &ldquo;Mother, I will go now and sell my wedding ring.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old woman, in a voice hardly audible, said, &ldquo;Daughter, are you married?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am, I am,&rdquo; answered Marie. &ldquo;Oh, mother, I have deceived, cruelly deceived you; the young Englishman, who, by his charity, has saved us often from starvation, is my husband; by his desire, our marriage was concealed even from you, for after the ceremony he told me that he was of a noble English family. Could he bring to a home like a palace a wife, a mother-in-law—ignobly born—paupers? No, no! &rsquo;twas too revolting. He&rsquo;s now gone to his family, by whom I never can be acknowledged. Death will release him from Marie; she will die neglected, heart-broken, without a friend to buy her even a shroud!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said Madame Duroc, &ldquo;you are your husband&rsquo;s equal; you are not, as you and all the world suppose, my daughter. My breath is nigh gone. Marie, draw nearer. In my youth I was the,.nurse of Mademoiselle de Préville, who married the Marquis de Valmour; they had a child, a daughter. The Marquis was old and infirm; the physicians declared he could not live long, and advised him to prepare for another world and to make his will. The next heir to the Marquis&rsquo;s estates, in default of a male heir of his body, was his greatest enemy, a distant cousin. Marie, I had a son, born at the time of your birth—a demon—hell itself possessed me—the Marquis bribed me. In the dead of the night I entered the Marquise&rsquo;s apartment; my heart failed me, as I saw her infant nestled on her bosom. She was awake, and inquired what brought me at so late an hour into the room. I answered not, but darted like a hungry vulture on his prey at her daughter. You, Marie, <em>you</em> are that daughter. I flung my boy on her bed, and rushed from her presence. There is written in gunpowder, on the back of my son&rsquo;s hand, the name of Duroc&rdquo;—</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman, no more,&rdquo; exclaimed Marie: &ldquo;but no, thou art no woman—fiend! was it for thee my love forsook me? is it for thee I am a beggar? May the torments of eternal misery be multiplied on thee, thou she-devil; there ranges not in hell another like thee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Marie paused,—her nostrils dilated,—fury in her eyes; she clutched the dying woman by the throat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now could I strangle thee,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but that would release thee from those racking pains. No, no, &rsquo;twould cease those gnawing, exquisite tortures, only to be succeeded by fiercer ones; those after death are more permanent, and thou shalt have them, ay, and feel them—<i>then</i> howl, <i>then</i> gnash thy teeth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She ceased, for there proceeded from the mouth of Madame Duroc a low sepulchral laugh. Marie relaxed her hold; the dying woman sank back, her glazed yet mocking eye still fixed on the girl;—gradually the laugh waxed fainter; a rattle in the throat succeeded, and Marie gazed on a corpse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; exclaimed she. &ldquo;God! oh gracious God! what plan am I now to pursue? for all to me seems darkness and despair. I am bereft of parents, home, husband—ah, husband! Henri, for thee I rave; I will brave more for thy sake, than ever woman braved for man before. But thou shalt claim me as thy wife. Oh, Henri! my love, my husband!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While Marie was thus wholly given up to her impassioned feelings, a sudden gust of wind burst open the door of the room; a volume of dense smoke issued through it. Marie heard with terror the screams of the other inmates of the house; she heard the crackling, and finally the falling in of the heavy beams; fierce flames fired the straw, and rendered glaringly visible the ghastly visage of the corpse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How to save myself,—for save myself I must,&rdquo; said Marie, &ldquo;and ere I die, Henri shall own me, as his lawful wife. Should he prove false,—well, then, in the bridal chamber, at the very altar, while he swears his perjured love to another, this dagger shall be plunged—eternal heaven! it shall—what! into his bosom—revenge myself on the idol I worship so intensely, so madly? No, no! away, ye cursed, damned thoughts, in Marie&rsquo;s heart shall the dagger lie and rust.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She then dashed towards the window,—a casement with bars of iron, which she tore away by force, till her small hands were steeped in blood. She had made an aperture large enough to admit her body, when, with a loud crash, the floor of the garret gave way. Marie crawled along the parapet, and her slight form was soon lost to view, by the dense clouds of black smoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How many persons perished in the fire!&rdquo; asked one of the many idlers, which the conflagration of the night before had drawn to the still smoking ruins.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They were all saved,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;except an old <i>lingère</i> who lay sick in the room under the roof, and her daughter, the beautiful Marie Duroc.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At these words a young and extremely handsome man, who was distributing alms to the wretched sufferers of the fire, sank down on the ground with a heavy groan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He must be an Englishman,&rdquo; was the remark, &ldquo;cette nation est remplie de sensibilité.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>THE COUNTRY.</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope and trust,&rdquo; exclaimed Honoria St Leger, the only daughter of Lord Harley, to her governess Miss Goodbody,—&ldquo;I hope and trust, that my cousin Henry Mortimer is <i>handsome!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Honoria, suppose you were to practice on the harp or piano, instead of wasting your time on a subject of such very slight importance,&rdquo; replied Miss Goodbody, sharply, who being <i>laide à faire peur</i>, herself, condemned all admiration shown to handsome individuals.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;since Lady Harley decided on your coming out this season, you have done nothing but talk of balls and flirtations, <i>en bref</i>, of all sorts of improprieties.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Coming out this season!&rdquo; burst from her impatient auditress; &ldquo;yes, that period for which I have so long panted is arrived. A month hence, and Almack&rsquo;s shall claim her queen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Harley now entered the room, and Honoria began industriously thumping on the piano, &ldquo;Suoni la tromba,&rdquo; with all her might and main.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t quite deafen me,&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Harley, affectedly; &ldquo;oh, this education must kill me! Honoria, I desire that you will come to dinner to-day in time to be handed in, instead of rushing in after the first course, disturbing every one at table, and at last plunging yourself in between some native and Miss Goodbody.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Honoria at this hint glided from the room, and in due time appeared in the drawing-room, the only occupant of which was Lord Harley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Honoria,&rdquo; said he, kissing his lovely daughter&rsquo;s forehead, &ldquo;Do you like the thoughts of coming out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I exist on the thought by day, I dream of it by night,&rdquo; replied Honoria; &ldquo;I am certain only very stupid people visit in country-houses; I have never seen any person I could like down here; but I am sure to like Henry, for Lady Jemima Charleton writes me word, &lsquo;qu&rsquo;il est beau comme l&rsquo;amour,&rsquo; and that he will be the rage in London this season. Jemima means to call him her especial favourite, for he dances the mazourka and galoppes to desperation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Harley, Miss Goodbody, and Mr. and Mrs. Percy Lennox now entered the room.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lennox was all <i>but</i> a pretty woman, and a most decided flirt;—it was her ambition to appear a naïve,—unsophisticated and innocent creature! &ldquo;qui disoit des platitudes, et qui débitoit des doubles entendres.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr., Lady Janet, and Miss Wilmington next made their appearance, looking as if just returned from the North Pole. Miserable objects people generally look after a long winter&rsquo;s drive to a country-house, and miserable did the Wilmingtons look when emerged from their toilette,—the ladies <i>torché</i> by the cold having numbed the hapless maid&rsquo;s fingers on the box, and the natural ruby of Lady Janet&rsquo;s cheeks having transferred itself to a temporary residence on her nose, from whence it glowed warmly.</p>

  <p>Lady Janet was the daughter of the Marquis of Kilrandy. Strange are the vicissitudes of life:—she had very nearly persuaded a Duke to marry her; when, without excuse or remorse, his Grace, <i>un beau matin</i>, gave her the slip, and married his bailiff&rsquo;s daughter. Lady Janet, on the principle of &ldquo;quand on n&rsquo;a pas ce qu&rsquo;on aime, il faut aimer, ce qu&rsquo;on a,&rdquo; wisely accepted Mr. Wilmington, a vulgar, rollicking, one hundred-ton-weight of a man, and M. P. for Sudbury.</p>

  <p>Miss Wilmington was a quiet, inoffensive girl;—one who went through her London campaign without partner, lover, or éclat; thereby escaping the cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails lash of criticism, which in the country is dealt out so unmercifully to every young votaress of fashion. She passed for a very nice person. Oh, the inconceivable and indescribable horrors contained under that denomination!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; said Lord Harley, &ldquo;we get to dine later every day,—are the Hotchkins&rsquo; expected?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are to endure that infliction,&rdquo; groaned Lady Harley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall be thankful to go to London, to escape all these natives. How people,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;can find pleasure in dining out in the country, is a problem I never could solve.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never could,&rdquo; thought Mr. Wilmington, in despair from the lateness of the hour of getting any dinner at all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; thought Lady Janet, as she felt her nose, which seemed in a blaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; thought the daughter, as she looked in the glass, and saw her hair all straight and blowsy over her face, giving her much the appearance of a she-bear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am dying to see your handsome cousin,&rdquo; lisped out Mrs. Percy Lennox to Honoria, anticipating a good flirtation in perspective with the said cousin. &ldquo;I have heard a great deal about him.—They say he is dreadfully wild (as if he were a partridge, thought Honoria) &lsquo;qu&rsquo;il a un air très distingué,</p>
