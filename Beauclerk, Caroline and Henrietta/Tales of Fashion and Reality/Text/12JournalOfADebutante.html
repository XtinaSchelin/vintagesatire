  <h1>JOURNAL OF A DEBUTANTE.</h1>

  <p class="author">BY CAROLINE FREDERICA BEAUCLERK.</p>

  <p class="smaller">A notorious characteristic of our English society is the universal <i>marketing</i> of our unmarried women—a marketing peculear to ourselves in Europe, and only rivalled by the slave-merchants of the east. A spirit of insincerity is thus encouraged among all women;—it is not talent, it is not virtue. It is not even the graces and fascination of manners that are sought by the fair dispensers of social reputation: No, it is the Title and the Rent-roll!<br />
  <br />
  <i>Bulwer’s England.</i></p>
  <hr />

  <p><span class="smallCap">I am</span> the youngest of five daughters and three sons. My mother gloried that her four eldest girls had all married men with large fortunes, and descendants of noble families, thanks to her unwearied exertions, and wonderful talents as chaperon! My eldest brother married a banker’s daughter. My mother took care that her daughters should marry into noble families; but, as she said, a man raised his wife to his own level in society—<i>l’argent comptant</i> was all that was required in my sister-in-law.</p>

  <p>I must now state the position of my family, when I went through the ordeal of being introduced into le beau monde. My father, Horace Vernon, was a country gentleman of very small fortune, who married my mother, because the daughter of a duke; whilst she herself, without fortune, was fearful of becoming an old maid. This union passed in the world for a happy <i>ménage</i>. Each exhibited a sort of peaceful contentment, on the philosophical principle of “What cannot be cured, <i>must</i> be endured.” During eighteen years, they lived in seclusion, when my mother, Lady Elinor, judged it expedient to exchange Bury Hall for a town mansion:—then broke forth her wonderful genius, her unfailing talent as chaperon; then it was she displayed the collected force of her faculties, and put in action a whole artillery of manœuvres. My four sisters danced at every ball with all the elder sons, and made <i>les beaux yeux</i> in every tableau. To make use of a sporting phrase, Lady Elinor succeeded in having a sure find, and having had a splendid run, bagged her foxes. To be sure, the husband of my fourth sister, may be said to have been run to ground and dug out, for my mother deemed it expedient to send my brother to ask the Honourable James Montague, that awful question of “Pray what are your intentions?” &amp;c.</p>

  <p>By the time I was sixteen, Lady Elinor was looked upon with affright, by the elder sons, and with detestation by the younger brothers, a race she held in horror. Caligula said, “Oh, that the Romans had but one neck!” that he might put them to death all at once, and I am certain my mother would have wished this to have been the case with all the detrimentals. On bringing me out, she requested I should find a good <i>parti</i> with the greatest possible expedition, as the funds of the family were at such a very low ebb, that next season we should have to vegetate in the country. With the agreeable prospect before me, of either marrying some booby, or of living at Bury Hall, the very thoughts of which gave me <i>une crispation des nerfs</i>, I went to my first ball with my mother’s consolatory assurance, that I possessed more means of making conquests than any girl going.</p>

  <p>To satisfy the curiosity of my readers, I must now give a description of my personal appearance. <i>Sans trancher le mot</i>, I was thought very beautiful; in justice, I must add, that I was reckoned prettier than I am in reality, for I have <i>une figure chiffonée</i>, which strikes every beholder; this, I attribute to a pair of almond-shaped blue eyes. My figure was slight and elegant, and I dressed to perfection. Unlike mamma, none could accuse <i>me</i> of ever running after the men. I was very lively, and had plenty of ready wit, which was a sufficient cause for my being much abused by most young ladies.</p>

  <p>Here I would observe, that I do not consider freedom of expression, and frankness of manner, proofs of an ill-regulated mind or heart. A girl may be witty, and not immodest—volatile, yet pure and chaste; and from my soul I believe “there is little virtue in a prude.”</p>

  <p>Holding these tenets, I heeded not the unkind speeches which reached my ears,—such as, “That girl has such a <i>ton de garnison</i>,—a word for every man;” “That Julia Vernon is a tremendous flirt; the gentlemen call her pretty, but I do not admire that dashing style of dress, unlike all of <i>us</i>,” &amp;c. I have remarked, that singularity in dress is never forgiven, be the offender man or woman. Hence those models of propriety, those Misses clad in sober hues, in home-made robes, “so proper and precise,” are always reckoned such very nice people.” No greater dowdy exists, than an English genuine, ”<i>charming woman</i>.”</p>

  <p>I shall now, for the instruction and edification of young <i>débutantes</i>, give an extract from my journal, in the month of July, the height and meridian of a London season. Oh, happy time! when every body seems to have taken leave of his senses. Balls, breakfasts, and operas—beauty, riches, and coronets—love, jealousy, and passion, are surely enough to make the young <i>débutante</i> lose both her head and heart.</p>

  <p>Such was my case: for a month I lived in a perpetual whirl of amusement and dissipation; in the mean time, as may be expected with a girl so popular as I was, I had plenty of lovers; but mamma thought I might look higher than to form an alliance with a commoner: she did not, therefore, encourage any of my <i>soupirans</i>.</p>

  <p>Things remained in this state till I became acquainted with Charles Stuart: in a word, he appeared just the beau ideal which my girlish fancy had pictured to itself for a husband. But now, as those youthful visions of hope and joy are fled as a dream, let me once more call to my mind his deep-toned voice—let me dwell on the form of the only man I ever loved—ay, loved, idolized, with my whole heart and soul. Let me call to my remembrance the features I have delighted to gaze upon,—of one who possessed “the glass of fashion, and the mould of form.” Yes; let me indulge in my weakness, or rather madness, and though now painful as it is to my throbbing heart, to write of one it is a sin to love, yet I have courage to perform the task.</p>

  <p>Oh, Stuart! Stuart! I can never forget thee. Time rolls on, still I think on thee, and the thought is madness! Oh, why did not death snatch me away, and thus have saved me years of mental anguish! but this gnawing grief at the heart, it does not kill. Ah, no; I linger on my weary existence day by day;—surely it is a mockery of woe, to lead a life of heartless dissipation, when the brightest hope has fled, aye and forever.</p>

  <h2>JOURNAL.</h2>

  <p>Monday, 4th July.—I was at a ball at Lady Clifford’s, when, dancing a quadrille with some spooney, to whose platitudes I turned a deaf ear, I overheard one gentleman say to another:</p>

  <p>“Who is that very pretty girl?” The answer was; “It is the all beautiful, the all charming Julia Vernon.”</p>

  <p>The gentleman who first asked the question, begged to be introduced to me. Lord Montreville undertook to form our acquaintance.</p>

  <p>“Fair Julia,” said his lordship, “you make fresh conquests every night; here is the handsomest man in London <i>épris</i> with you.”</p>

  <p>When I first looked at Charles Stuart, I felt gratified that I attracted the attention of so distinguishé’d looking an individual. I sank beneath the ardent glance of his dark eyes.</p>

  <p>“At length, Miss Vernon,” said he, “the moment for which I have so long panted is arrived.”</p>

  <p>Lady Georgiana Clinton, who was literally pounding down the middle and up again in a galoppe, at this instant nearly knocked me down, vociferating loudly, “Oh, why don’t you dânce, it is so delicious, I am quite mad!”</p>

  <p>I danced this galoppe with Charles Stuart, and I may state, that I was as mad with delight as Lady Georgiana, though I did not evince my insanity so boisterously. Mamma insisted on coming home early,as she said with a mysterious air, “<i>il est parti</i>.”</p>

  <p>Oh heavens! why was I such a fool, as to dance with Lord Montreville three times to-night. My motive, I own, was to ask him questions relative to “the handsome Stuart,” as he is called. When at home, I was so restless and uneasy, I did not know what was the matter with me. I alternately looked at a carnation which Charles Stuart had given me on leaving the ball-room, and on my ball-dress, with an air of complacency, murmuring to myself: He certainly is handsomer than any man I know; but it is not the beauty and regularity of his features that charms me; no, nor those eyes. It is that open, frank, ingenuous look he has:—melancholy, I should say, was the prevailing character of his face. But when he smiles, what a radiant sun-like smile it is! Thus, thus, was I filling a cup of misery for myself, the very dregs of which I have since drained. I went to bed, my head aching, my heart throbbing—and when I slept, I dreamed of Stuart.</p>

  <p>Tuesday, the 5th.—Was engaged to go to Lady Montresor’s breakfast at Putney. I found all the people are very <i>fade at ennuyeux</i>. The young ladies actually seemed tied to their mammas; and kept pacing like the ghost in Tom Thumb, “up, up, up,” and “down, down, down,” on a gravel walk, to the destruction of satin shoes, and under the influence of a broiling sun in the dog-days. I have no doubt but that mamma is delighted to see that Lord Montreville admires me; but with her usual policy, she pretends not to observe it. To effect this, she put up with all the horrible vapid <i>bétisses</i> of Captain Fergusson, and giving me the slip, down an avenue of a mile long, set off with him <i>au grand galop</i>, leaving me alone with Lord Montreville.</p>

  <p>This last-named nobleman is not deficient in good looks; but he is very fat, and has a high colour in his cheeks, which is a thing I detest in a man. Well; we walked about. Lord Montreville, I am sure, found me very dull, for having had him a long time on hand, I had exhausted every topic. He kept saying to me, “Come, Miss Vernon, say something clever! when you like it you are such a deuced nice girl.” Here I must observe, that nothing so effectually stops my mouth as any body begging of me to say something “clever;” it makes me feel <i>d’une ignorance crasse</i>, and as if I had not one idea of my own. Thus we dawdled on till dinner-time,—I boring poor Lord Montreville with the <i>réfrain</i> of, “Where can mamma have hid herself?” a regular young lady’s question, by the way, when she is looking for some one more congenial to her taste than the beau she is inflicted with;—such was my situation. At last I said, “I do not see <i>that</i> Mr. Stuart here to-day.”</p>

  <p>“Oh, I dare say,” replied his lordship, maliciously, “if he had known that Miss Gray had been here, he would have come.”</p>

  <p>I instantly saw that envy prompted him to say this; I therefore answered, with apparent nonchalance, “Pray, which Miss Gray is his ladye-love?”</p>

  <p>“Hang me if I know or care,” replied Lord Montreville, hardly listening to me; “probably, the little red-haired one.”</p>

  <p>I really could have boxed his ears for his impertinent stupidity; but keeping the usual equanimity of my temper, added, “People generally admire by contrast.” With my ordinary quickness at reading people’s minds, I instantly read in Lord Montreville’s that he was jealous of Charles Stuart; and that he wishes to be as much the soul’s delight of every one, as he is the delight of his own. At length, like two weary footpads, we reached the house. A general move amongst the company,—chaperons getting animated,—a sparkling in old, and also in young gentlemen’s eyes, and trains of lovers seen pouring from dark groves, where no doubt many a heart had been wooed and won, indicated that all the assemblage were repairing to commit carnivorous and graminivorous devastation. We followed a file of hungry people, looking as if playing at the game of hen and chickens. Lord Montreville ate, I do think, a gallon of white soup; the champaign flowed <i>en ruisseau</i>, and seemed to have any thing but a soporific effect upon him, as the flattering communication, that I was an angel, with sundry amorous effusions, were the effects I witnessed thereof. Mamma pretending not to see us, seemed quite taken up with Captain Fergusson,—a most useful man, much patronized by chaperons. He was their victim, who would run from one end of the colonnade to the other for their carriages after the opera, in a drenching night. He was ugly, and considered a very <i>safe</i> man.</p>

  <p>Just at this time Weippert’s band struck up a galoppe; the contrast struck me forcibly of my delightful partner of the night before, and the gluttonous and unromantic mastication of Lord Montreville, devouring a plateful of cutlets and green peas.</p>

  <p>“I perceive,” said his lordship, “that Fergusson means to ask you to dance, but I look upon you as engaged to me.”</p>

  <p>Now, between the two evils I instantly decided in my mind that I had better pair off with Lord Montreville than with Fergusson: in the first place I thought it would satisfy mamma, for I dreaded the solitary drive homeward, when I had been guilty of any little incipient flirtation with my favourite younger brothers. In the second instance, Fergus-son literally <i>spoons</i> the galoppe, with his foot pointed like a dancing-master. Lord Montreville, who I suspect was suffering from indigestion, which I do not at all wonder at, was so blown, that he begged to stop almost immediately; he said, “You do take one at such a pace,—you’ll be the death of me. By Jove,” continued Lord Montreville, with visible alteration in his face and voice, “if there isn't Stuart, as large as life.”</p>

  <p>My eyes involuntarily followed the direction his lordship’s took, and I saw Mr. Stuart leaning against the door, with his large, dark, lovely, lustrous eyes, gazing full upon me. My heart beat, till I thought it must burst. To disguise my agitation, I nearly laughed myself into hysterics at one of Lord Montreville’s puns, to whom I civilly remarked, “Pray, go and ask Lady Georgiana to dance; she is such a love of a girl,—you must be sick to death of me.”</p>

  <p>“Upon my honour. Miss Vernon,” replied he, “you are too bad; I know you are dying to get rid of me, that you may dance with that fellow, Stuart. But what will Lady Elinor say? Oh, Julia! I wish to Heaven you had some of your mother’s pride! It strikes me, to be a favourite of yours, one must have one hundred pounds per annum, <i>pour tout potage</i>; good God! how lean I should get upon that!”</p>

  <p>Lord Montreville so engrossed me, that I could only give Charles Stuart a look, as much as to say,—Your turn next; nothing lasts for ever. With the reflection of <i>ce qui est differé, n’est pas perdu</i>, for my consolation, I submitted to be dragged round and round till the end of the galoppe. We then went into the refreshment room, where Lord Montreville was soon engaged in drinking coffee, and eating bread and butter: in the meantime Mr. Stuart came up, and begged the honour of my hand for the next dance;—so I slipped off.</p>

  <p>Good heaven! that such a difference <i>could</i> exist between two men,—Charles Stuart, so gentle and engaging in his manners,—so noble and generous in his sentiments,—so high-minded in his notions,—and Lord Montreville, without one grain of sense in his head. Ah! <i>II faut être folle pour aimer un fou!</i></p>

  <p>Returning home, mamma said, “Thank goodness, I have done my duty, and Captain Fergusson is ended for the day; positively, I had to hook the man into a corner, and put my chair right before him, to prevent him asking you to dance, which he kept threatening to do; I have been much pleased with Lord Montreville this day.”</p>

  <p>“Oh pray, mamma,” interrupted I, “spare me, I am sick to death of him; I am sure I am quite tired of hearing him talk about his eternal waistcoats, and the French polish on his boots.”</p>

  <p>“My dear,” rejoined Lady Elinor angrily, “when you are Lady Montreville, it will not signify to you whether he wears a <i>strait waistcoat</i>, or goes barefooted; the thing is, to make him ‘pop the question.’”</p>

  <p>“Oh, mamma,” I said, “does it not behove a wife to <i>honour</i> her husband? and, really, I despise Lord Montreville. If you consult my happiness, suffer me to marry a man I can <i>love</i>.”</p>

  <p>“My dear Julia,” answered my mother, “I am convinced the happiest marriages are those dispassionate ones, when the parties joined in wedlock bear nothing more than a reasonable regard for each other. They should be affluent, have each their separate course of amusements, and see each other rarely; for absence is the only salt that preserves matrimony from cloying. Swift says, ‘Married people, for being so closely united are but the apter to part, as knots, the harder they are pulled, break the sooner.’ For myself, I hold all love as mere sensualism, and view protestations of mutual and eternal adoration as ravings. I am quite of Dr. Johnson’s opinion, that ‘It is always a weak man who falls in love.’ ’Tis beyond man’s might to love, and at the same time to retain wisdom; the passion of love is folly in a man; it amounts to indelicacy in a woman. I was extremely displeased at your leaving Lord Montreville to-night, to dance with that puppy, Mr. Stuart. What could induce you to commit such an unpardonable <i>gauchérie</i>; and who is this Mr. Stuart?”</p>

  <p>“He is the grandson,” I replied, “of the Marquis of Brandon.”</p>

  <p>“Good God!” vociferated my mother, “a set of beggars! there really ought to be an Act of Parliament issued against such tigers, monopolizing the time and attention of a fashionable girl.”</p>

  <p>Lady Elinor’s parting words for the night, were, “I flatter myself we have <i>jockeyed</i> his lordship.” As for me, I burst into a flood of tears, and wept till I thought my heart would break. All that I could give utterance to, was. Oh, how heartily do I wish that every one had a competency of four thousand a-year, then there would be no angering of fathers and mothers, no breaking of girls’ hearts, no family dissentions, and very few unhappy marriages!”</p>

  <p>Wednesday.—Coming down this morning, found Lord Montreville, Captain Cleveland, and a whole battalion in the drawing-room with my mother, who said, “Here read this letter from that old quiz, Lady Trimleston; she gives a party at Richmond this week.”</p>

  <p>The note, which I read out loud, ran thus:—“Miss Brown is deputed by Lady Trimleston, to express her regrets that Lady E. Vernon cannot assist her in looking over her visiting list this morning, for the purpose of asking the company to Lady Trimleston’s <i>dejeuné à la fourchette</i>, on Thursday next. Lady Trimleston encloses two dozen of blank cards, in case Miss Vernon should feel disposed to ask any <i>eligible</i> men.”</p>

  <p>“Who is Miss Brown?” asked Lord Montreville.</p>

  <p>“Oh, a dreadful woman, or rather old maid,” replied mamma, “she lives at the antipodes, up in Baker Street, and being poor, is too happy to play <i>la complaisante</i> to Lady Trimleston, who being a foreigner does not understand the English language.”</p>

  <p>“Whatever you do,” added I, “studiously avoid becoming acquainted with Miss Brown; there never existed a more spiteful and malicious woman; never having been able to make a match for herself, she tries and breaks them for others. She wishes every one to think her a <i>dear little thing</i>, which you cannot reconcile yourself to, for she is like a grenadier in petticoats. She is at daggers drawn with me, for the vulgar creature once told me, that she did not think <i>small beer</i> of herself; of course not, I replied, for you are <i>brown stout</i>.”</p>

  <p>“Does she go about?” asked Lord Montreville.</p>

  <p>“Yes,” replied mamma, “she goes to the ancient musical concerts, and appears at Almack’s in a <i>Barége</i> gown, the night before the Derby, generally denominated ‘The refuge for the destitute.’”</p>

  <p>“I once waltzed with her in Dublin, where I was quartered last summer,” chimed in Captain Cleveland, ”and she flounced about so, to make herself appear young, that she finished by giving me such a tremendous <i>coûp de pied</i>, that I thought she must have broken the small bone of my leg. This made me look at the width and breadth of her foot, which, to use a vulgar, but expressive phrase, was a complete <i>beetle squasher</i>.”</p>

  <p>“My goodness! Captain Cleveland,” cried I, “what an opportunity she gave you to say, ‘If you love me, tell me so, but do not kick me.”</p>

  <p>“Love her!” exclaimed the young Captain, with a shriek of horror, “why, the woman is just like a laughing hyena!”</p>

  <p>“She puts me more in mind,” I replied, “of an ogress; those long front teeth of her’s, seem admirably calculated to perforate holes in the flesh of human beings, and suck their blood!”</p>

  <p>“I am <i>au desespoir</i>,” said mamma, “that I was too much knocked up this morning to look over her visiting list, for when she asks the company for Lady Trimleston, they are such a set of odd people.”</p>

  <p>“Quite tag rag, and bobtail,” added Lord Montreville.</p>

  <p>“This London life kills me,” continued Lady Elinor, “and next week I must begin to think of packing up, and enjoying a little calm at Bury Hall,” giving Lord Montreville a look, which meant, “if you intend to propose, be not a century in doing it.”</p>

  <p>When Lord Montreville had departed, I went to Mrs. Somerton’s, to rehearse with her daughter a <i>charade</i> they were getting up. This lady has earned the reputation of being the greatest fortune-hunter in London; she does bold strokes for husbands, but she does not perform them with that finish which distinguishes mamma’s efforts. The difference between the two may be better understood, when I state, that a gentleman once remarked, that Lady Elinor’s <i>manœuvring</i> was like Sir Thomas Lawrence’s painting, whilst that of Mrs. Somerton, resembled more Stanfield’s scenic paintings at the theatres. She had three very pretty daughters, and she moved heaven and earth to get them married, which was easier said than done, for Caroline Somerton, the eldest, as her mother told me, was very headstrong, and would not listen to reason. She had taken it into her head to flirt with a young life-guardsman, a Captain Damer, and I believe matters had come to a proposal. Mrs. Somerton declared she should never marry such a scamp; Caroline, however, replied, “Where there's a will, there's a way.”</p>

  <p>We went to Almack’s at night. I am come to the conclusion that these are the pleasantest balls in London; a fresh and elegant dress shines there, and not having to go through the fatigue of making <i>de fausses complimens</i>, you are much more independent.</p>

  <p>Lord Montreville said that I was the prettiest girl in the room, which pleased mamma so much, that she bestowed on him that much used expression, “I am sure you are very good.”</p>

  <p>I am not surprised at a London ball-room striking foreigners with admiration. The patrician and courtly bearing of the high-born ladies of fashion, and the aristocratic thorough-bred look of their daughters, bear away the palm from every other country. I admit that when an Englishwoman is <i>ugly</i>, it is to a surpassing degree. I wish my pretty countrywomen would reform both their style of dress, and their mode of dancing. The subject of female dress has been deemed important enough to be commented on by Addison, and many other learned men. Sir Philip Sidney maintained that “the comeliness of the clothes, depends on the comeliness of the body.” Julius Caesar passed an edict, forbidding unmarried women wearing jewels. Female attire has now no such guardians; <i>fashion</i> rules all with despotic sway. If sleeves resembling balloons are in vogue, the Brobdignac of five feet nine, and the Liliputian of four feet odd, wear them the same size. Why should not every lady have a style of dress of her own, instead of adopting that system of uniformity which exists in a London ball-room? Every chaperon is seen dressed in the “regulation” satin robe, with the ordinary accompaniment of a velvet, or crape hat, and feathers. The young ladies all dressing so much alike, give a <i>salon de danse</i> the appearance of a large national school.</p>

  <p>Let ladies, who wish for becoming and <i>récherché</i> dresses, imitate the elegance and grace displayed in the toilettes of Mademoiselle Mars-Leontine, Fay, and Madame Vestris. But let them beware of seeking their models from the <i>English</i> stage, though this was done formerly. I have been told that Mrs. Abingdon was besieged by ladies of rank for the pattern of her gowns, &amp;c.; Abingdon caps were adopted, <i>en fureur</i>. Since then, it seems, a change has taken place, and youth, talent, elegance of deportment, and chasteness of dress, are at a discount.</p>

  <p>Fanny Kemble has retired from the stage, and we no longer possess at either of the national, or at any of the minor theatres, a Juliet, a Beatrice, a Lady Teazle, a Lady Macbeth, or a Bianca. The same lamentable fact is visible amongst the actors:—there is not now a Romeo to be seen, for love or money! Neither is there any one capable of personating young Mirabel, Lord Townly, Charles Surface, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The singers are decidedly increasing and improving, for we can boast of Mrs. and Mr. Wood, Misses Romer, Sheriff, and H. Cawse, Messrs. H. Philips, Templeton, Barker, Collins, Wilson, and Balfe—all agreeable singers, and fitting in personal appearance to act the parts of heroes and heroines.</p>

  <p>As for the dancing, reform it altogether. Oh! why will not mothers <i>force</i> their daughters to learn battemens and glissades, and make them <i>plié chassé—pas bourré, &amp;c</i>, to work out the English stiffness, and to give them a little <i>abandon</i> in their gait. The confidential quadrille, the inspiring galoppC) the fascinating Ionian waltz, the seducing mazourka, and the coquettish cotillon, have, I am aware, been condemned by the English, as romps. But is it necessary, that a young girl should resemble her great grandmother;—or is a young man expected to be a petrifaction? I have heard many times, that light heels denote a light head. This theory I hold as quite unmeaning, and ridiculous. Tradition tells us that Socrates, the greatest of all philosophers, joined in the amusement of dancing. I, who put my whole heart and soul into the galoppe, that most delightful of all dances, am quite grieved to see the <i>indolent</i> way, in which it is danced in England; really, the manner in which some of them <i>hop</i> in it, is disheartening. As I was following a great fat girl, who, to use a masculine expression, was a regular <i>jack</i> of a woman, I overheard one of that numerous genius, y’clept <i>toadies</i>, exclaim to the chaperon of the <i>jack</i>:—</p>

  <p>“What a difference there is between your charming daughter, and that little mad thing Miss Vernon,—what a romp she makes of this dance, floating about like a Bayadère, and dressed unlike every one else, even to her shoes. My goodness! look at them!”</p>

  <p>I glanced my eyes from my own foot, <i>chausée par parenthèse</i>, in Le Saunier’s best, to the “<i>understanding</i>” of my rival,—something resembling a cow’s hoof, in a pair of shoes, the price of which I should conclude was five shillings and sixpence. Mamma was very angry with me, because I preferred dancing, to staying with Lord Montreville, who sat by her all night. Another civil speech I overheard, was, “Lord Montreville has been sitting in Lady Elinor’s pocket the whole night. I suppose she is trying to catch him, for that flirting girl of hers.” I turned sharp round, and discovered my friend in Miss Brown. I could have beat her black and blue, but merely stared her full in the face, and gave a dead cut:—really the impertinence of this woman is past endurance.</p>

  <p>After a most delightful galoppe with Charles Stuart, we were repairing to the tea-room, when I saw Lord Montreville following me.—I pretended not to see him, but quietly seated myself, and began sipping a very hot cup of tea, a very good excuse, by the way, when you wish to have a good flirting bout, when to my great horror and dismay. Lord Montreville came and placed himself between Mr. Stuart and myself. After looking at me with the eye of a basilisk, he said:—</p>

  <p>“Pray Miss Vernon, am I to understand that Mr. Stuart has supplanted me; for since you have known him, you avoid me, as you would contagion.”</p>

  <p>I answered with a voice tremulous through shame and vexation: “May I ask, my lord, by what right you thus question me?—Mr. Stuart,” continued I, rising, “will you return with me into the ball-room, and take me to my mother?”</p>

  <p>“On my soul,” burst forth the indignant Lord Montreville, “you shall not go with him.” At the same time grasping my arm, with a hand of iron.</p>

  <p>“Pray, pray,” I cried, “unloose me! Mr. Stuart, do not go; pray assist me. Lord Montreville, what right have you thus to insult me? I demand you to unhand me!”</p>

  <p>Mr. Stuart then said, “You surely cannot wish to detain Miss Vernon by force.”</p>

  <p>“I beg you will not dictate to me,” returned his lordship, haughtily. “Miss Vernon, say you forgive me,” continued he, as he saw me ready to faint through shame and terror: “will you have a glass of water?” he cried, in the greatest alarm.</p>

  <p>More dead than alive, I replied, “Your conduct has been, Lord Montreville, most unprovoked, and ungentlemanlike. It is your absence alone that can set all to rights.” Here my heroism could support me no longer, and I burst into tears;—they both seemed shocked and amazed.</p>

  <p>“My dear Miss Vernon,” cried Lord Montreville, “pray do not cry; I cannot bear to see a woman weep. Take a little water—pray do not cry, my dear creature, every one is looking at you.”</p>

  <p>When you say to a child, “Pray don’t cry, darling,” it is a signal for him to burst forth with renewed vigour. Such was my case—the more Lord Montreville said, “dont’t cry,” the more I wept, and sobbed, as if my heart was breaking, so mortified and ashamed did I feel at the whole affair; and at hearing people around me say, “What is the matter?” “what is it?” A general murmur had informed mamma, that I was <i>prima donna</i> in a <i>scena</i>: when I saw her, I greeted her in a Siddon’s tone, with, “Take me away—take me away!”</p>

  <p>She could not conceive what had happened, but thought it best to take me down stairs: in her heart she must have rejoiced in it, as Lady Sopwell, Mrs. Crampton, and two or three notorious <i>commères</i>, craned their necks to catch a look at my face, saying, “May we congratulate you. Lady Elinor?—It is very natural she should be overcome, poor thing!” &amp;c &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Mamma did not contradict their supposition, but was whispering to Lord Montreville, who followed, looking like a naughty child. Mr. Stuart had got the carriage for us, into which Lord Montreville handed me like a Niobe all in tears.</p>

  <p>“For goodness sake! what has happened!” cried my mother, as we drove off. “Has Lord Montreville spoken out like a man? Has he proposed? Speak, child—I have had enough of heroics and scenes to night.” I then explained the cause of my tears, upon which, she coolly replied,—I should be extremely angry with you, but, that I think it may bring matters to a crisis. I am convinced he loves you, in which case, I do not wonder at his being jealous of that horrid Stuart, to whom you could not make yourself more agreeable, had he twenty thousand a-year!” To this maternal lecture I could return no answer.—Alas! I could not help loving one, bereft of title or fortune.</p>

  <p>The next morning Mr. Stuart called, but he had hardly seated himself a minute, before mamma said,—“I am going to do a very rude thing Mr. Stuart, and that is, to turn you out of my house—(putting on a forced laugh,) “as we are on the point of setting out to a <i>dejeuné</i>.” When he was gone she remarked,” I cannot suffer my drawing-room to become a refuge for penniless scamps. Heigho!” continued she, “I hope to God you will marry Lord Montreville—that will be a great charge off my mind. Good heavens! no one can form a conception of the exertion and anxiety I went through to get your sisters off. But how successful I was! Men, will laugh, talk, dance—ay, make love to a girl, but how difficult is it to make them propose! Even Mary’s husband—ugly, hunchbacked creature as he is—did I not risk my own son’s life to frighten him into marrying her?”</p>

  <p>“Ah, poor Mary!” said I, “<i>what</i> a man you made her marry!”</p>

  <p>“Therefore, Julia, ought you not to be thankful, when I work like a galley slave to get such a man as Lord Montreville for you;—who, besides being the eldest son of an earl, with a clear thirty thousand a-year, is straight, and as men go, is not deficient in good looks?”</p>

  <p>“Spare me, on that subject,” said I, shuddering, “it makes me sick.”</p>

  <p>“It makes <i>me</i> sick!” rejoined she, fiercely, “to see you whining and pining, when I am moving heaven and earth, to gain such a prize—such a prospect for you! But Julia, let us understand each other—I have not yet told you the dreadful, appalling state of destitution we are in. I have not yet told you, that this house, has, at this very moment, an execution in it—that Bury Hall is mortgaged to thrice its value—that your father has fled the country, and left his wife and children beggars! You are also unaware, that the necklace of gems you wore last night, my jewels, the plate, horses, and carriages, have all been taken from us, to satisfy our merciless creditors. Do not gasp for breath, prepare yourself for more terrible things. Now hear me, Julia, solemnly swear before God and you, that no other shall win and wear you but Lord Montreville.—You start, ungrateful girl! I have sworn it, and I will not retract one jot. Nay, weep not—tears are useless: look at me—do I weep, Julia!” continued she, as she gazed fixedly on me. “If I thought but for one moment, nay, if I only dreamt that you loved Stuart, I—even I—your mother, who till now have been your dearest, best friend, would cast you from my bosom, as I would a viper.—Ah!” she screamed, as with terrific force she pulled me towards her—“am I right; you sought to deceive <i>me</i>—to make <i>me</i> your dupe—you <i>love him</i>! Hell and madness! is it even so?—Gracious powers! that I should be plunged, headlong as it were, into such a gulf of misery. Fool! fool!—continued she, pacing the room in great excitement, “would you deprive yourself of the very bread you eat, which you would, if you married Stuart But, no; sooner than that should be, I would follow you to your grave, a cold and stiffened corpse. But,” cried she, with renewed energy, “if you would give yourself wholly up to your disgraceful sensual passion, you will at least feel the reward of a good conscience, when you see us in beggary, and in want. Yes; you will praise your own generous feelings, and say, ’twas I who took the bread from their mouths! ’twas I who dashed the cup of water from their parched lips! ’twas I, you will continue, in exultation at your fine feelings, who turned them adrift in their old age!—’twas nobly done! But what shall <i>we</i> say? <i>We</i> shall bestow heavy, deep <i>curses</i> on our ungrateful child.”</p>

  <p>“No, no, no,” cried I, in an agony, “not curses; do not curse me! Oh, my mother, spurn me not, have pity on your child.”</p>

  <p>“Could you ask our blessing?” said she, “No, I say; our curses should lie at your door. If you hate <i>me</i>, at least show some milk of human kindness to your aged, infirm father, whose pilgrimage in this world of sorrows will soon be over. Oh, God! what a serpent’s tooth is a thankless child!”</p>

  <p>Here she threw herself upon the couch; her sobs were deep and long. Never had I seen human passion so terrible; her whole frame quivered with emotion; the very couch on which she had cast herself shook under her, from the excess of her passion. There she lay,—her teeth chattered against each other, her eye was glazed, her cheek like marble!</p>

  <p>“Mother, mother!” I cried; she answered not I could not bear the sight of her agony. The excess of grief I had gone through had exhausted me; my head reeled; objects swam in confused order before my eyes, and I sank lifeless on the floor.</p>

  <p>When I came to my senses again, I found mamma and my maid chafing my temples with <i>eau de Cologne</i>. My mother seemed to have recovered from the effects of her late excitement; no traces of it were visible in her face; perhaps her cheek looked a little paler than it was wont.</p>

  <p>“Lissette,” said she to the attendant, “go, and fetch Miss Vernon's Bonnet, and bring down her India shawl.”</p>

  <p>My surprise may be well conceived, when I heard my mother say, “Mrs. Somerton is waiting at the door; make haste, my dear, she is going to take us to Whitehall Stairs, as I told her my coachman was ill.”</p>

  <p>I faltered out, “Oh pray, dear mamma! let me stay at home; indeed I am too ill to go out to-day.”</p>

  <p>Though she might have seen the truth of this statement in my pale cheek and hollow eye, she made no answer, but assisted to dress me. I made no resistance,—I felt completely in her power. I was suffering from the effects of her anger towards me. Her threats, her curses were ringing in my ears. I could scarcely crawl as I followed her into Mrs. Somerton’s carriage.</p>

  <p>She had completely recovered her calmness, for she began talking to that lady on the most indifferent subjects.</p>

  <p>Caroline Somerton was in high spirits, and began telling me that it was in the Morning Post that Lord Montreville had challenged Charles Stuart. “But tell me, Julia,” she said, “when did the conquest take place?”</p>

  <p>“In the reign of William the Conqueror, year 66,” answered her mother, who was deaf,—(great objection, by the way, to a chaperon, who should have the use of <i>all</i> her faculties).</p>

  <p>“No, no, mamma,” replied her daughter, “in the reign of William the Patriot, year 36.”</p>

  <p>“Pray, do you know,” asked Lady Elinor, “whether the rich and hideous Charlotte Lorimer is to marry Lord Neville or Sir Willoughby Dartmore?”</p>

  <p>“I have settled,” answered Mrs. Somerton, with a triumphant air, “that she does not marry either. She thought, no doubt, that her riches would put the smiles and bright eyes of a pretty girl at a discount; and that all men preferred five thousand per annum to a snowy skin, and a rent-roll to a red lip. Having three daughters, all handsome and portionless, I considered it my duty to prevent such a nefarious transaction, as an heiress <i>buying</i> a husband. Well! I engaged Lord Neville in conversation, and though I felt in a devil of a humour, I invented several puns for his amusement; and at a convenient opportunity fired off the following:—‘Why is Charlotte Lorimer like Mount Vesuvius?’ Of course he was <i>très bête</i>, and could not say why; but I kindly told him—‘Because she is subject to <i>eruptions</i>. Of course he repeated this to Sir Willoughby. A man will often marry a rich old woman he cannot like,—he may take a wife, knowing her to be a consummate fool,—but men will rarely wed the object of a strong disgust.”</p>

  <p>Arrived at Whitehall Stairs: as I was stepping into the boat I heard mamma say, “Oh dear, Lord Montreville, I am so glad you’re come; just help Julia.”</p>

  <p>When I heard his hated name, and on his attempting to hand me in, a loud scream involuntarily escaped me, as I drew back my hand in horror.</p>

  <p>“Captain Damer! Captain Damer!” screamed out Caroline Somerton, at the hightest pitch of her voice, as a set of gentlemen-rowers pulled up alongside our boat; “I insist on your joining our party. How lucky, to be sure,” continued she, blushing with delight, “that we should find you here, as we just want one more rower,—William Vernon being on guard.”</p>

  <p>Poor Mrs. Somerton looked daggers at her daughter, but to no purpose, as Caroline did not take the slightest notice of her, and was not quiet till she had established her favourite beau, with an oar in his hand. I am quite convinced that this <i>ruse de guerre</i> of hers was a preconcerted plan.</p>

  <p>Mamma sat between Lord Montreville and my-self, and said with doating love, “The air will do its dear little head good.” She then tried to make Montreville as much at his ease as possible, by devoting her whole attention to him; and giving him advice in the most confidential manner, and with an air of mother-in-law solicitude. As for me, I sat miserable and wretched, well aware that I must choke if I attempted to speak.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Somerton was in a dreadful humour; found fault with every thing, and nearly upset us by fidgeting from one side of the boat to the other. Her daughter Caroline was in high glee, and kept saying, “How dull you all are! one would think you were all sea-sick, except, indeed, Julia Vernon, who looks love-sick. For the gentlemen,—</p>

  <p>“Lord Montreville parait trop chaud;<br />
  Captain Fergusson n’est pas très beau;<br />
  Les Dames muettes, ne cnsent le mot,<br />
  Et tous les hommes sont bêtes, et sots!”</p>

  <p>When we arrived at our appointed destination, Caroline Somerton and Captain Damar disappeared very suddenly, to Mrs, Somerton’s great annoyance.</p>

  <p>Lady Trimleston (the giver of the d<i>ejeuné</i>) was of ignoble birth: her lord was dead. She had worked herself, by indefatigable industry and perseverance, into a certain set, and was patronized by Lady Elinor; not because she was fashionable, but my mother had <i>ton</i> enough of her own to be able to <i>friser la corde</i> sometimes. The fact is, she had <i>carte blanche</i> to ask all the young men she chose to Lady Trimleston’s parties; who, poor woman! was too honoured in feeding and amusing mamma’s high-born and fashionable acquaintance. It is certainly a curious anomaly—giving parties for other people’s friends. Lord Montreville quizzed her very much, and gave her the <i>soubriquet</i> of <i>La Chiffonière</i>, on account of her asking “the lame, halt, and blind” to her house. Nevertheless, his lordship pronounced her œ<i>uil de perdrix</i> champaign excellent, and vowed she was “a good old girl.” Her activity was wonderful; her tongue incessant. She was for ever asking questions, but fortunately had not the patience to wait for the answers; she had a weak, squeaking voice, as Captain Cleveland remarked, something like a penny trumpet in a consumption. This lady had a son, a youth of thirty years of age, “the apple of her eye;” and fearful was she of any chaperon pouncing on “this gentle tassel” as their prey. Amongst her other . qualifications, she was perpetually giving people “nick-names.” Her <i>boy</i>, as she usually designated this great lump of humanity, she called “<i>Chou-chou</i>;” Mamma was denominated “<i>Bibi</i>”—I was elegantly named “<i>Bijou</i>,” and Lord Montreville fell under the designation of “<i>Coco</i>.”</p>

  <p>We had not been long at Richmond, before Miss Brown came up to me, and said, “Thank'you for cutting me last night—what’s the matter with you to-day?—are you like me, who fall in love fourteen times in a fortnight?”</p>

  <p>I turned from this disagreeable creature in disgust, and attempted to speak a few words to “<i>Chou-chou</i>.” Whether his mother had primed him never to speak to young ladies, I know not; I tried the creature on every subject, but had he been deaf, dumb, and blind, I could not have been listened to, spoken to, or looked at less than I was.</p>

  <p>Whilst I was putting on an animated look, which, <i>par parenthese</i>, I have the knack of doing, <i>á volanté</i>, that mamma might not pester me with Lord Montreville, the dinner was announced. There was a general rush; but mamma kept tight hold of Lord Montreville’s arm, that he might not be carried away by the stream.</p>

  <p>A lady much over-dressed, and with a face of the brightest, most vivid scarlet, passed by, apparently to the displeasure of Lady Trimleston, who said to her confidante, Miss Brown, “There is old Miss Beetroot, <i>chienne de femme</i>!—I must take care that she does not <i>enlévé mon Chou-chou, étoile de ma vie, joie de mon existence</i>.”</p>

  <p>“What a set of odd people she has,” whispered mamma; “who ever heard of the name of Beetroot!”</p>

  <p>“A German name, I should fancy,” said Montreville.</p>

  <p>At last we were all seated except Mrs. Somerton, who was gone in search of her daughter. Mamma positively guarded Lord Montreville like a dragon, till she saw him safely placed between me on one side, and the lady with the <i>cérise</i> face on the other, judging her to be perfectly harmless. As to Lord Montreville, he seemed most anxious to make amends for his conduct the night before, in putting forward every energy to render himself agreeable. To effect this, he began by carving an immense pigeon pie, and offered some to a little cross-looking woman opposite to us, who had a little child on her knee, and a gentlemen next to her, whose auricular nerves did not seem very acute, as he was obliged to have recourse to an ear-trumpet. Lord Montreville civilly said, “Will you have a little of this pie, ma’am?” She refusing, this good-natured young man said, “Will you ask your better-half, the stout old gentleman next to you, whether he will have any?”</p>

  <p>I instantly saw that something had gone wrong, by the change that overcast the lady’s face, as she said, “This gentleman, sir, is <i>my</i> father.”</p>

  <p>Several of the young ladies were so foolish as to laugh at this. As to poor Lord Montreville, he looked quite frightened, and said to me, “How black she looks—what shall I do?”</p>

  <p>I answered, “Speak to your neighbour, and look as if nothing had happened.”</p>

  <p>“Oh, my Jove!” said he, “she is so ugly!” Nevertheless, with the most implicit obedience, he said, “Miss Beetroot, may I have the honour of taking some champaign with you?”</p>

  <p>“Sir!” said she, her face getting perfectly crimson, “how dare you insult me in such a manner! It is very surprising that you should so far forget yourself, as to upbraid me for my complexion. But I know <i>where</i> you learnt it—I am as God made me. Know, sir, that my name is Robinson, and not Beetroot!!'</p>

  <p>By this time she had pumped herself up into the most violent hysterics, and was carried out of the room screaming and kicking <i>les pieds dans l’air</i>—Lady Trimleston, in fits of laughter, screaming out “<i>Ah! mon Dieu, j’en mourrai—ah, ah, ah! Milord Coco</i>, how well you did say dat to her. <i>Ah Dieu! ai'je ri?—je ne’en peux plus</i>.”</p>

  <p>Lady Elinor, much displeased, kept saying, “Really, Lady Trimleston, you should not subject people to this, with your detestable nicknames:”—but she was unheard, on account of the shouts of laughter which proceeded from that lady.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this uproar and confusion, poor, fat, old Mrs. Somerton rushed into the room, in a state of distress, very evident in her manner and complexion:—“My dear Miss Vernon,” said she to me. “Caroline has set off, with that <i>bête noire</i> of mine, George Damer. I have been up Richmond Hill, and down again, and cannot find her—my palpitations are dreadful—you are young and can run fast. Pray don’t refuse my request—none but a mother can tell what I feel.”</p>

  <p>Lord Montreville said, “Come, Miss Vernon, a run up the hill will do us both good.”</p>

  <p>I was about to refuse, really not having the constitution and strength to go; but mamma gave me a look so terrible, that I winced beneath her glance. To oblige Mrs. Somerton, Lord Montreville and I accordingly raced after the fugitive, like two policemen after a pickpocket. But having made the tour of the park, without success, we returned to the house in time to find Mrs. Somerton flat on her back in a fainting fit, and every one in a state of dismay. As all the ladies were tormenting the unfortunate woman—one deluging her head with water, another burning a feather under her nose, &amp;c. &amp;c. I took up a letter, which I found open on a table, which contained the following agreeable and edifying information:—</p>

  <p>“Do not be angry, my dear mamma, with me, I have taken decided measures, but I trust to be happy with the man I adore. Riches bring not happiness with them, and <i>he</i> is not rich—but I shall never be a burden to you. It is useless to pursue me, for you can never persuade me to forsake my husband. “Caroline Damer.”</p>

  <p>I was much surprised and amused, that she had gained her point so well. When I heard <i>la voix glapissante</i> of Miss Brown, who was genteelly forcing her handkerchief down her throat, to stifle the effects of her risible propensities, I went to her and said, “In a moment like this, be not so unkind as to laugh.”</p>

  <p>“0h,” she cried, “I am such a merry-hearted <i>little girl</i>, that I can even find <i>fun</i> in others’ woes. When I saw,” continued she, “Miss Somerton set off with such expedition, I boded she was after no good—a little sly thing! So I followed her to Richmond church, where she was married with the greatest composure. She then wrote the letter in the vestry room, (into the window of which I peeped,) gave it to the clerk to deliver to her mamma, and then set off with her beloved in a carriage and four. Trust me for finding out a hornet’s nest—it was all preconcerted.”</p>

  <p>At length Mrs. Somerton came to her senses again. Her other two daughters thought it best to take her home by land. Mamma was obliged to go away also, for, said she, “If I return by water, I cannot go in a hackney coach from Whitehall Stairs to Park Lane.”</p>

  <p>Mrs. Somerton was in a dreadful state, crying and sobbing most violently, and murmuring out, “It is all that boat, that horrid boat! Oh, my child! my child! who refused a duke to marry a beggarly ensign! She, the beauty of London, to live in a barrack yard! Oh! Caroline! in losing you, I have lost my heart’s idol, my own pet child—ungrateful, cruel Caroline.”</p>

  <p>Really the laments of this poor bereaved woman, <i>m’ont navré le coeur</i>. When we were seated in the carriage, mamma said, “Pray come in. Lord Montreville, I assure you there is plenty of room.”</p>

  <p>“Indeed, I won’t submit to that,” cried Mrs. Somerton, with great spirit; and recovering in the most sudden manner, “Have mercy on my horses. Lady Elinor, we are five already in the coach—drive on!”</p>

  <p>She then shut her eyes, and tied, <i>en chaperon</i>, her handkerchief round her head. Her daughters were frightened, and did not speak; neither did I nor Lady Elinor, till at last the silence was broken by mamma asking whether the Somertons were going to Lord Mornington’s grand ball, which was to take place the following night.</p>

  <p>“No,” replied Mrs. Somerton sharply, “we are not fine enough for him,—the airs people give themselves are disgusting:—pray, what are the Morningtons, but law-lords? I always tell Mr. Somerton, who seems to have a sort of delight in making his family out a set of quizzes, that Lord Mornington would give half his fortune to have one drop of our blood in his veins.”</p>

  <p>“He'd purchase it at a high price at any rate,” observed Lady Elinor.</p>

  <p>“No,” continued Mrs. Somerton, “we are not going.”</p>

  <p>“I wish we were,” sighed Clara Somerton.</p>

  <p>“You know, Julia, that Charles Stuart is his nephew, and as he is every thing to his uncle, and as you know him so well, I thought perhaps you might get us an invitation—would you, dear Julia?”</p>

  <p>“No, she cannot,” said Lady Elinor, peremptorily; “the thing you ask is an impossibility.”</p>

  <p>The conversation was again dropped, nor was silence broken until we stopped in Park Lane. At the door of our house we saw my brother William.</p>

  <p>“Well,” said Mrs. Somerton, “I thought you were on guard.”</p>

  <p>“Not I,” replied he, “I have been ready to hang myself all day, from want of something to do. I suppose I was not asked to row you down to Richmond, because I am a <i>detrimental</i>, eh, Mrs. Somerton?—Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you an immense piece of news:—George Damer’s uncle, Sir Henry Fitzwalter, a strong, hale man, broke a blood vessel this morning and died immediately,—consequently George Damer is one of the greatest <i>partis</i> in England perhaps.”</p>

  <p>“Merciful Powers! I thank thee!” ejaculated Mrs. Somerton. “Captain Vernon, prepare yourself for a surprise, Caroline married him this morning.”</p>

  <p>“I am sure she had my full consent so to do,” replied my brother.</p>

  <p>“How seldom one meets with so much romance and reality. If every one could have what was wished, what a general massacre of rich uncles would take place,” remarked Lady Elinor.</p>

  <p>The next morning mamma had such an influenza, that she could not leave her room. Lord Montreville called, and I really believe staid three hours: I thought he never would have gone away. He said, “Miss Vernon, 1 have something very particular to say to you. Will you allow me to defer it until tonight?”</p>

  <p>When he was gone, mamma said, “I cannot go to-night to the ball,—I am certain Lord Montreville will propose—I charge you not to dance with that Stuart,—mind, Julia. I will be obeyed;—on your answer to Lord Montreville depends the existence of the whole family.”</p>

  <p>I went to this ball, chaperoned by Lady Darnley. In happier days I used to say that her daughters, the Ladies Maxwell, were the most humdrum girls I ever met with, for they were content to dance at balls with a married man, and were quite amused at hearing how well his little girl learnt the pianoforte, and how the little boy liked Latin and Greek, with other equally agreeable domestic details. When we got into the ball-room, Lord Mornington said to his nephew, “Charles, you shall open the ball, go and choose some lady.”</p>

  <p>He immediately sought me;—I refused—it was a desperate effort, but I did refuse. He looked very blank at this, but instantly recovering himself, asked Lady Sophia Maxwell to open the ball. Oh, how I envied her! a pang of jealousy shot through me. Never had I before observed her fine expressive eye. Ah! thought I, a large fortune makes the crooked look straight, and changes red hair into bright auburn. So, continued I, here am I, Julia Vernon jealous of Lady Sophia, and she does not seem to dislike his attentions. Has she then found out that a handsome man is more agreeable to dance with than an old quiz?</p>

  <p>“Why so pensive—fairest of the fair?” said a voice near me:—it was Lord Montreville.</p>

  <p>“Julia,” continued he, “May I, before I pour the whole flood of my passion into your ears, before I humble myself to the earth before thee, beautiful tyrant! may I hope that you will give me some encouragement? may I hope that you do not <i>hate</i> me?”</p>

  <p>I bowed my head in silent grief; alas! what could I say? I remembered the account I should have to render to my mother.</p>

  <p>“Oh, Julia!” he said, “I thank you for your silence, it has given me hope—it has given me courage to proceed. Never have I seen any woman so lovely, so perfect, both in body and mind as you are. Julia, you are the soul of truth;—can you say you love me,—but pardon me, I see this distresses you. Unfeeling monster that I am to have no regard to your feelings, and thus expose them to the frigid gaze of these heartless votaries of fashion! Will you see me to-morrow morning?”</p>

  <p>I rose and said, “I shall be prepared.”</p>

  <p>Had I staid a moment longer in the ball-room I must have fainted away. I quickly passed through a suite of splendid apartments, till I got to a dark room dimly lighted, there I wept unobserved. “Oh, my mother!” cried I, in an agony, “you cannot again curse me, for I have sacrificed all for you.”</p>

  <p>I staid there nearly an hour with no other company but my own miserable thoughts, when I heard a step near me:—the blood rushed to my head—my heart beat with giant force against my side, till I thought it must burst—yes, it was no mistake—it was—Stuart. He started, seeing me, and was about to retire.</p>

  <p>“Mr. Stuart,” cried I, quite bewildered, “do hot let me drive you away.”</p>

  <p>“I was fearful of intruding—of perhaps again offending,” he said.</p>

  <p>“<i>You</i> offend me! indeed, indeed, you never offended me!”</p>

  <p>“Yet why shun me—why refuse to dance with me?”</p>

  <p>“Do not blame me,” I said; “I have been taught to believe every evil, without <i>one</i> redeeming quality, to be yours—I have been told to shun, to avoid, aye, even to hate you.”</p>

  <p>“And who,” burst from the lips of the indignant Stuart,—“who is the foul-hearted demon, who would traduce me to you,—angel of beauty and goodness that you are? Tell me—who is my traducer, and by Heaven!”—</p>

  <p>“Hold!” I cried; **your enemy is <i>my</i> mother!”</p>

  <p>“Oh Julia!” said Stuart; “it has indeed cut me to the heart, to hear that you are taught to hate one, whose destiny is in your hands—one who loves you, with.a love approaching unto madness.”</p>

  <p>“Love <i>me</i>!” I shrieked, quite beside myself; “love me!—better would it have been for both had you said you <i>hated</i> me!—Oh, Stuart! wherefore say this?”</p>

  <p>“Julia, hear me one moment,” said he; “my fortune is not large; I cannot place a coronet upon that lily brow;—I cannot purchase you with gold; but if the most devoted, lasting love^—"</p>

  <p>“That word again,” I cried; “banish it for ever. Nay, Stuart, thou shalt!—thou <i>must</i>! I cannot draw down a punishment from heaven by listening to you. Stuart! I have sworn to wed another. Heaven and earth have witnessed the oath. I cannot be a perjurer!”</p>

  <p>“Julia,” replied Stuart; “if you will consent to fly with me this night, an aged parent shall be a mother to you. Oh, Julia, Julia!—Will you, my own loved one, consent to fly with me. My Julia—idol of my heart—will you—will you?”</p>

  <p>“No!” I said; “it must not be—not one word more—not a step nearer. Stuart! the maiden who could be so lost, who could so far forget herself, as to forsake her parents to follow the man she loves, is unworthy to reign in such a heart as yours. She who has deceived once may deceive a second time. Oh, Stuart!” continued I, throwing myself in an agony at his feet—“as you would be merciful to my peace of mind—leave me; it is hard for one so young as I am, to be sacrificed at the altar of ambition. Leave me; you know that I have .not fortitude to resist your entreaties;—do not force me to leave a name in the world with the foul accompaniment of dishonour—shew some lenity for me; oh! persuade me not against my duty, or I shall expire at your feet.” He spoke not again—I looked on him. Never had I seen a face so changed by grief; the agony he suffered was too dreadful for me to witness.</p>

  <p>I had thought my own woes unparalleled till I saw his; I thought the cup of my misery was filled to the brim, till I saw grief more dreadful—more appalling than mine; the drops of agony stood on his brow—he moved not—he seemed transfixed. I could bear the sight of his anguish no longer; I rushed out of the room, and, with the swiftness of lightning flew down stairs. The people must have thought me mad, indeed I felt quite distracted. Thus, thus, I parted from him, without wishing him a farewell for his happiness. No good-bye—no kind wish—nothing. Fortunately for me, Lady Damley never staid later than one o’clock at any ball, and I found her waiting for me in the cloakroom. When I reached home, I received a message that my mother desired to see me. When I entered her room, she said:—</p>

  <p>“Julia, has Lord Montreville proposed?—he has?—I thank thee, Heaven!”</p>

  <p>I sank by her bedside,—she was evidently much affected as she motioned me from her room. Oh, what a night I passed! Great God! I never can forget it. “Alas, alas!” I cried; “I have no friend—no protector, to counsel and befriend me. Stuart knew not what he said, when he asked me to elope with him. To my sisters I could not go; they would spurn me,—they would say, come not to us, we married against our own inclinations; why should not you?—why are you to be the favoured one? My uncle, Lord Morven, too, what would he do for me,—aye, for me his idol—his much-loved Julia? He would say, “Come not to me, you married a beggar; follow then the trade, the calling of a beggar;—if you cannot dig, be not ashamed to beg; beggars have no shame.”</p>

  <p>The next morning mamma was better; she sent me down stairs to speak alone to Lord Montreville. What I suffered from the conflicting passions raging in my bosom is not to be described. “Courage!” I said to myself; “I have gone through much; more is still required ere the grave close over its victim: blessed and much wished for consummation!—Lord Montreville,” said I, “I am now going to trespass on your patience in suffering me to speak plainly to you. You tell me that you love me; you ask me to return that love. Alas! frankly I avow that it is not in my power to do so. You must have seen that my heart is not in my own keeping—never can be mine. At this moment I love another—aye, love him, though I bow in submission to my duty. But this is not all. I cannot marry you under a false impression. Montreville, we are beggars. To you we shall be dependant for the very bread we eat. Does not this deter you? We lived beyond our means; creditors became importunate; we had not wherewith to satisfy them. My father heard of a speculation by which, if he hazarded his whole fortune, he might become possessed of millions. My mother expostulated, reasoned, entreated of him, not to run so great a risk.—It was all in vain. He staked every thing—all we had. He lost that all, and made us beggars!”</p>

  <p>“Now Julia,” replied Montreville; “listen to me. I have loved you long and fervently; but though I feel at this moment that I would risk my life, name, fortune, all I own most dear to win you, your generous confidence has placed me in so despicable a light, that I will renounce you. Yes, Julia! though heaven bear witness how I love—adore you even to idolatry, yet be happy with Stuart!—I will, I must renounce you!”</p>

  <p>“<i>Never</i>!” cried my mother, as with fury sparkling in her eye, she rushed into the room; “never, while I have life, shall she wed another save you. My lord! my lord! is this the conduct of a man? Do the clashing of swords, the cries of the wounded, the sight of millions dying around a warrior make him flee from the field of battle, and brand his front with the name of coward? and would you, for a few tears, a few sighs, renounce the hand you are trying to win?—Shame, shame on you! show more manhood. And you, madam!” continued she, turning fiercely to me; “do you brave me?”</p>

  <p>“No, no, mother!” cried I, falling on my knees before her; “if Lord Montreville will accept of a blighted, widowed heart, if he will accept of a spirit humbled and broken, of a form faded and crushed by sorrow, I am his! Oh, mother! do not again curse me; do not curse your last-born child! Montreville, plead for me.”</p>

  <p>“It is well!” said my mother, imprinting a kiss on my burning forehead. “Montreville, into your hands do I commit my child; be to her a good and an honourable husband. Guide her through the intricate and slippery paths of life: see that she swerve not from the right way. Shield her from all the temptations and snares of a wicked world, which is as a ‘wolf in sheep’s clothing.’ Befriend her in sickness and in sorrow. Be her protector, guardian, friend. Love, honour, and cherish my beloved child!”</p>

  <p>“I will!” said Lord Montreville.</p>

  <p>“Swear it!” demanded my mother.</p>

  <p>He took up a Bible which lay on a table, and kissing the sacred volume, said, “I swear.”</p>

  <p>“And now, Julia,” continued my mother; “I charge you, as you value your own honour, and your parents” peace, depart not from the duty you owe your husband, and your Creator. I charge you, as you value your own immortal soul, to love, honour, and obey, your husband.”</p>

  <p>“I swear,” alone broke from the lips of the broken-hearted child. Lord Montreville, enraptured clasped me to his bosom; he called me his bride, his beautiful. Man as he was, tears gushed from his eyes, and the big drops rolled down on my neck. I did not weep, my heart was nigh breaking; but not a tear escaped me. Even as he held me to his bosom, I thought on the future. The horrible vision rose before me. A week hence and I should be his wife. Engaged to be married to one I did not love, when I loved another;—so intensely—so devotedly. It was no dream! No! it was a dreadful, palpable, reality. I had vowed, aye sworn, to wed one I abhorred. Nothing could now save me. The thoughts which crowded on my bewildered brain, were maddening. I tore myself from his embrace with the force of a maniac, and rushed out of the room.</p>

  <p>When my mother came, as she afterwards told me, what a scene presented itself to her! There, on my bed I lay, my white dress dabbled with blood; my eye glazed; she thought me dead; I had broken a blood-vessel. During that night, she imagined every moment would be my last. But youth is strong, and sorrow seldom kills. In the morning a change came over me, I gradually recovered, and in a week was able to see my affianced husband. But oh! grievous was I to look upon. I might indeed have been compared to a vessel at sea, the morning after a storm, when the raging blast has totally dismantled her; all her beauty gone, a very wreck...... One only consolation was left me in my great affliction; one gleam of sunshine threw a light upon my gloomy path. My poor old gray-headed father would, in the wane of his years, descend in peace into the grave.</p>

  <p>Lord Montreville would sit hours and hours by my side, content with only gazing at my face. One day he said, “Julia! when a young maiden has given her whole heart to one object, and that by some untimely accident she loses him, her only hope and joy; after a time, a long, long time,—would it be possible she could ever love again?”</p>

  <p>“No, Montreville!” I replied; “that intense, devoted love you speak of, can never be transferred,—never, never!”</p>

  <p>“Then Julia,” asked he; “is there no hope for me?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, Montreville!” I said; “torture me not with visions of the past, I have been like the maid you speak of; who loved, who idolized one object; I never can <i>love</i> again. My esteem, my confidence, my most devoted friendship is yours.”</p>

  <p>My mother fixed, at length, the wedding day; t was passive; indeed, since my dreadful illness, she could find no fault with me. I performed all she required; I made no resistance. The morning of my nuptials she arrayed me with her own hands in the bridal dress of a sepulchred heart, “Never did you look so lovely,” exclaimed she, in maternal pride, as she clasped a row of pearls around my throat, which might have paid ransom for a king. The magnificence of the preparations for my nuptials filled my heart with grief and despair. I was a victim, but I could not retract. I had sworn, and must abide by my oath.</p>

  <p class="sep">* * * * * * *</p>

  <p>I have performed my task; visions of gone-by days still cleave to my memory. At the banquet, at the ball, I am the proud, the haughty bride of Lord Montreville; but in the solitude of my chamber, I pray God to release me from the horrible phantoms which for ever pursue me... The time will soon come when the cold, damp, and narrow recesses of the grave will receive all that will remain of my mortal frame. Yet a little while, the jewelled hand that guides the pen through this narrative of my life will be withered. The dooming sentence, “Thou shalt die and not live,” will soon be verified in me. There is no grasp whose tenacity could hold me much longer from the sepulchre. Then let me wait mine hour with resignation. It must,—it will,—soon come!</p>
