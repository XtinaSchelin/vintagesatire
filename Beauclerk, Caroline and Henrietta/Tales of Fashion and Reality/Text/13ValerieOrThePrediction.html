  <h1>VALERIE, OR THE PREDICTION.</h1>

  <p>A TALE OF LIGNY.</p>

  <p class="author">BY HENRIETTA MARY BEAUCLERK.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wrapt in the study of the heavenly sphere,<br />
  He neither cares nor feels for those who&rsquo;re near<br />
  Absorbed in the mysteries of his art,<br />
  He therein reads the secrets of man&rsquo;s heart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s cunning of disguises! spite of locks,<br />
  Skin vesture—it is she, and only she!<br />
  What will not constant woman do for love,<br />
  That&rsquo;s lov&rsquo;d with constancy!</p>

  <p>Hunchback.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><span class="smallCap">Nothing</span> was spoken of in every station in Paris but the great battle that was soon to decide who was to be master of the universe. The streets were quite deserted; the very lamps suspended across them seemed not to give their accustomed light; darkness and terror reigned throughout. The places of public worship were attended only by a few devotees, praying for their countrymen, who, perhaps, were all doomed to perish, and finally to rest in unhallowed ground. Most of the houses were barred, and firmly closed, as if they imagined the enemy already at the city gates, and that their wooden shutters would protect them from injury.</p>

  <p>Yet in every position, however critical, the fairer part of the creation never forget one very important thing, namely, their dress. With them vanity is an innate feeling, and from the highest to the lowest, every female offers up her tribute to the altar of fashion. Even at that time of night, milliners&rsquo; girls might be seen, hurrying along,—fear printed on every feature, carrying, perhaps, some splendid apparel, which was soon to adorn a Parisian belle at a select female coterie, for no male person was now seen to grace the apartments of the elegant and beautiful; France calling on all who were able to fight under her banners, to immortalize their names and sovereign.</p>

  <p>In a dark, narrow street, in the suburbs of Paris, a tall figure, closely muffled up, was seen moving rapidly along. The individual appeared to be perfectly well acquainted with the road, intricate as it was; and though stopping repeatedly, it was from fatigue, rather than fear, occasioned by the distance of the alley from the more habitable part of Paris.</p>

  <p>One house, if such it could be called, stood apart from the other wretched dwellings, and through its low casement, obscured by dust and age, a lamp emitted its feeble and dying rays. The first story projected two feet over the ground-floor, and showed signs of rapid decay. Most of the plaster had fallen off, from age, and exhibited the laths to which it had once adhered. One side of the house was propped, and though this necessary precaution had been used, part of the upper story had given way, and was crumbling down.</p>

  <p>The figure now cautiously approached the door, and knocked; silence prevailed: the stranger again rapped, and receiving no answer, entered the house. All was dark within: the stranger heeded not the obscurity, and, with some difficulty, found a small door in the passage, which, on pressing a spring, opened. The room was filled with smoke. The new comer, unable to distinguish any objects, paused. &ldquo;Who comes at this hour of night?—the fates are not propitious.—Away, away! tempt not fortune: hence! fly from this den of wretchedness, where all is misery.&rdquo; The speaker hastily rose, and snatching a lamp from the table on which he was leaning, approached his apparently unwelcome visiter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is my coming unlooked for, learned seer?—surely to-night was the time appointed?—hast thou forgotten me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cloak dropped from off the stranger, and Valérie de Livaraux stood before the astrologer. &ldquo;The Marquise de Livaraux! and alone!—How could one so fair as you venture hither, unattended, at this late hour?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have I to fear?—Paris is deserted, all are gone, young and old, and the unhappy Valérie is left alone, to mourn. Oh, Martignie! am I doomed to see thee no more? Shall those loved features be trampled under foot by thy foes? Shall no friendly arm shield the blow from thy devoted head?—Yes:—one shall save thee, one shall watch, in,the hour of strife, and rescue thee!—But come;—do the fates smile on my destiny, or is the future doomed to be as hopeless as the present?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady, in my searchings after futurity, I have learned strange things; but thy destiny has surpassed them all. For thine own sake I would not that ye knew it; promise then, that for the space of nine days, this paper shall remain unread by thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! is it so terrible that you dare not breathe the words, and have committed to paper what you fear to tell me? But I am strong, and can bear it; nought can fright me; speak, oh speak! shall Martignie ever claim me as his wife?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Never</i>!&rdquo; replied the astrologer, and in a minute he was rubbing Valérie&rsquo;s hands and temples with spirits, trying to restore her—for she had fainted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ought to have borne the communication better; but I did not think to hear such a sentence. Only one more question will I ask: Can I do aught to bring about our union?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing; forgive me, lady, if I pain you; but it were better to be frank. Ere this day month Martignie will cease to exist. Farewell, then: hie thee to thy home, and strive to forget one who never can be thine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forget! Know ye so little of woman&rsquo;s love as to fancy I can ever forget my affianced husband? Bid the angry volcanoes cease to raise on high fire and smoke from the bowels of the earth! Command the vulture prepared to seize his prey, to desist, and henceforth feed no more on blood! You read my fate, but not the sentiment of my heart. Now listen: as long as the warm blood thrills through my veins, and gives life to my body, so long will I love him; sleeping or awake I think but of him, and sooner than forget one I esteem dearer than life, I would put an end to an existence hateful without him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="sep">* * * * *</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Marquise de Livaraux wears too much rouge decidedly,&rdquo; exclaimed Madame de Guétrie to her married daughter. &ldquo;She does not seem to regret the absence of De Martignie much,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;or to trouble herself about the perils he will have to encounter. I never could imagine why she accepted him; nothing but a common adventurer. &rsquo;Tis true he was handsome, but I prefer blood before looks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her daughter sighed, as in her mind she contrasted her own old husband with De Martignie. None knew what was passing in Valérie&rsquo;s mind, or the state of her feelings, an hour before she had left the astrologer, whose conversation had decided her fate for life. Was her heightened complexion then to be wondered at? But no trace of agitation could now be observed.</p>

  <p>At an early age she had the misfortune to lose her parents, who appointed her uncle, the Vicomte d&rsquo;Harcourt, sole guardian, who, with his wife, educated her till the age of fourteen, when he was killed by a fall from his horse. Contrary to the custom of the time, Madame d&rsquo;Harcourt introduced Valérie, unmarried, in the world when she was only eighteen. All wondered who would be her choice; but that was soon decided. Among the numerous suitors for her hand, the Chevalier de Martignie was, in less than three months, acknowledged as her accepted lover. A sort of mystery hung over his birth and rank, yet Valérie heeded it not; she had wealth, and where could she bestow it better than on the man she loved? The marriage day was fixed; but how uncertain are the events of this life! De Martignie received an order to join the army, in which he said he held the rank of Captain. Valérie, in vain asked what regiment he belonged to, and where it was stationed; to all her questions he returned evasive answers. What did this mean? could Martignie deceive her? No, it was not in his nature; he was too good, too generous, to betray one who trusted in him so fully. Paris was placed in a complete state of defence; Napoleon was going to engage in a battle with England. For the protection of the frontiers during his campaign, Suchet was intrusted with the command on the frontiers of Switzerland, with directions to attack Montmellian as soon as possible, after the 14th of June, which day Bonaparte had fixed for the commencement of hostilities. Massena was ordered to repair to Metz to assume the government of that important fortress. Napoleon quitted Paris with these memorable words, &ldquo;I go to measure myself with Wellington.&rdquo; Ney was sent to Frasnes to drive the English from Quatre Bras. Napoleon went to Ligny, and Derlon with a division, amounting to ten thousand men, was placed near Marchiennes, serving as a centre of the army, either to support Ney or Napoleon; whichever might require assistance. On the 16th of June, two battles took place: that of Ligny was the principal action. The French Emperor was unable to concentrate his forces till three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, at which hour it began with uncommon fury all along the Prussian line. The Mareschal Grouchy had given the word of command to march to the village of St. Amand to the relief of Bonaparte, when one of his aid-decamps informed him that a young man well armed wished to speak with him, though it were but for a minute; at the same time begging the Mareschal to be cautious, in seeing a stranger, who was so mysterious in his manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never fear, he will not harm me; but quick, bring forth the stranger.&rdquo; A space was cleared before the Mareschal; a young man stepped forward and dropped on one knee; he was clothed in the same uniform as the soldiers; in his hand he held an unsheathed sword, which evidently had never been stained with blood. His face was so pale, but yet so beautiful, that the Mareschal paused astonished. The youth before him had not yet arrived at manhood, but sorrow hung heavily on a brow which resembled Parisian marble, so bloodless was it. A fire scarcely human lighted up his dark eye, his pale lips quivered through suppressed emotion. The Mareschal at last broke the silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rise, young man, and tell me your bidding; do you bring despatches from the Emperor? or have you learnt tidings of the enemy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither, sir;—I come from Paris to offer myself as private in your regiment. I have travelled night and day, to reach this place in time, and through all my fatigue, that hope has sustained me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no time for further parley. You know not, boy, the danger you will go through in the approaching battle: even now, we are on our road to the field of action; stay here and rest, your body is bowed down with fatigue, you are unfit to fight—Soldiers, on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay, stay!&rdquo; cried the youth, &ldquo;I am strong and will follow. If you deny me the privilege of fighting under your banners, alone will I hie to the combat, and though I die in the attempt, win a name of glory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Join the ranks, then, quickly, for now we must use no delay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Grouchy joined the Emperor, the French had obtained possession of part of the village of St. Amand, after an attack of two hours. The sight of their comrades inspired them with fresh vigour; every danger and every toil were forgotten; and once more shouting, &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo; Empereur!&rdquo; they renewed the attack. The heart of the young soldier who had just joined, sickened within him, as he gazed upon his fellow-creatures falling rapidly at his side. How many mothers, widows, and orphans, would mourn this day? How many beheld the brave, the beautiful, go forth to battle, in the pride of youth, and the bloom of health? Years have passed away, and memory asks, where are they now? Gone! all gone! their bodies serving to enrich the ground, and from their ashes have sprung bright flowers, raising their heads luxuriantly over the last resting place of the brave. The sole support of an aged parent is no more. The hand that propped the sick child&rsquo;s head is powerless. The faithful lover, whose return is anxiously looked for, will never more hear the words of affection breathed by loving lips. The ardent eye will never again gaze on objects dear to every feeling of the heart. All slumber in an unbroken sleep, trampled on by the living; the anxious father could not now recognise in the mangled corpses before him, his own brave and beloved boy.</p>

  <p>A tear trickled down the soldier&rsquo;s pallid cheek, as he gazed on the scene before him. His comrades all fought with desperate rage; they thought of nothing but exterminating the enemy. His arm alone hung as if paralyzed; onwards he rushed to the charge, but yet his sword was unstained with blood; his wandering eye anxiously scanned the features of his companions in arms; no friend could he find among them. Anguish now took possession of his soul, and tears rapidly chased each other down his care-worn cheek. Bullets flew past, yet was he not touched; blows were given, yet was his body unharmed,—he seemed to possess a charmed life. The battle now was on the wane: numbers fell on each side; the Prussians became more desperate, as their defeat appeared more certain; the combat grew less general; the ranks were broken; each singled an adversary on whom to vent his hate and rage. A Prussian officer, decked with many orders, attacked the youth, who, till now, had remained passive. His sword was raised, and nearly touched the unknown&rsquo;s head, when the latter, snatching a pistol from his belt, discharged it at the Prussian; one word alone escaped his lips, as he dropped dead at the feet of his destroyer, and that sound reached only the ears of his murderer. Another half-hour, and all was over; the din of battle, the clash of swords, the fading smoke, had all passed away, and Napoleon was master of the field! No sound prevailed save the moans of the dying, who were ordered to be attended to, and their wounds examined; whilst the dead were to be interred on the field of battle.</p>

  <p>Mareschal Grouchy was much surprised on beholding the attendants approach, carrying in their arms the young soldier who had that morning joined, to all appearance lifeless. They said he had been found on the dead body of a Prussian officer; no mark of violence was apparent about his person, and he was not dead, for they could feel his heart beat. &ldquo;Remove his cap, and bathe his face with water; let every thing be done for his recovery; &rsquo;tis a pity that one so young should perish.&rdquo; The cap was removed, and clusters of dark hair fell over the young man; restoratives were used, and in a short time the patient&rsquo;s eyes unclosed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;De Martignie,—where am I?&rdquo; Could that look, that voice, be mistaken? No—it was Valérie de Livaraux; need we say her victim was De Martignie! &ldquo;Ha! what horrid thought is this which flashes to my mind—the name he breathed, was mine. Yes, I have killed him!—My hand fired the shot.—Ha! there he stands,—and points to the wound in his bosom. Yes, De Martignie, I will extract the ball; I have killed you, and now will I restore you to life. Nay, shrink not from my touch; fear not, I will not harm thee.&rdquo; She paused, and pressed her throbbing temples with her hands, which were stained with the blood of De Martignie. &ldquo;The astrologer spoke foolishly,—we shall be, we are united—nought shall separate us; fly not from my embrace, poison is not in my touch—Martignie! Martignie!&rdquo; and stretching her arms forward as if to embrace some object, she once more fainted.</p>

  <p>Tedious was her recovery, and when life again animated her frame, Valérie was deprived of reason! Little now remains to be said. Ralkreuth, a captain in the Prussian service, undertook, for a large reward, to proceed to Paris to spy the movements of Napoleon. For that purpose he assumed the name of De Martignie, and in that character, won the heart of the beautiful Marquise de Livaraux. Short was their love—fatal their end. The body of the Prussian spy was interred with victims of glory. There was no friend present to shed a tear to the memory of the brave, every one was revelling and rejoicing in victory. Quickly the liquor flowed, and gladly was it drank by the over-fatigued soldiers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us drink health and victory to our brave master. Napoleon! and may our foes perish on the field of Waterloo!&rdquo; exclaimed a veteran, who had remained steadfast to Bonaparte through all his fortunes. The elated warriors shouted the toast, and fresh filled their glasses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice, whose melancholy tone contrasted strangely with the present feelings of the assembly.</p>

  <p class="stanza">&ldquo;Fixed was her look, and stern her air;<br />
  Back from her shoulders streamed her hair;<br />
  The locks, that wont her brow to shade,<br />
  Stared up erectly from her head;<br />
  Her figure seemed to rise more high,<br />
  Her voice, despair&rsquo;s wild energy,<br />
  Had given a tone of prophecy.<br />
  Appall&rsquo;d, the astonished conclave sate.&rdquo;—<i>Scott.</i></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never again shall Napoleon be victorious. On the field of Waterloo thus shall his standard be dashed to the ground as I dash it—thus shall it be trampled on as I trample on it. When the sun sets that even, the eagle shall no more soar on high, inspiring its brave followers to fight for its honour. Ere the sun sets that night. Napoleon shall cease to be emperor. Start not; it is written in the book of fate in characters of blood!—Martignie, on that night shalt thou claim me as thy wife! Stay, unloose not my hand, I am thine! I&rsquo;ll follow thee to death!&rdquo; Valérie (for it was she) rushed from the tent, and the next day her body was found stiff and cold on the outskirts of the village. Thus perished one, whose existence was her love, and by whose hand, one who was dearer to her than life, fell.</p>

  <p>Woman&rsquo;s love, when excited to the highest pitch, becomes a species of madness, that nothing can put a stop to;—like the mighty waters of a rushing torrent it sweeps every thing before it, marking utter desolation in its track. Love is a leveller of all things; there is no obstacle, however great, that woman&rsquo;s wit cannot surmount; rank is made equal,—fortune neglected,—age unheeded,—all forgotten, save the actual passion.</p>

  <p class="stanza">&ldquo;The tender fancy smarts with every sting,<br />
  And what was love before, is madness now.&rdquo;</p>
