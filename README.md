# Legal Bit

This is for public domain, out-of-copyright books and such, so *no restricted files*! Original books *only*, not recent reprints of same!

# Folder Structure

Please add books into their proper folders:

```
./[last, first of author]/[book title]/Text
./[last, first of author]/[book title]/Style
./[last, first of author]/[book title]/Images
```

Add folders as you need to, of course.

# Guidelines

Be true to the text: spelling, grammar, even genuinely obvious typos.
